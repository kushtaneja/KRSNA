      "purport" : "Bhagavad-g?t? is the widely read theistic science summarized in the G?t?-m?h?tmya (Glori?cation of the G?t?). There it says that one should read Bhagavad-g?t? very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of?r? K???a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g?t? itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G?t? directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand the Bhagavad-g?t? in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will ?nd in the Bhagavad-g?t? all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also ?nd things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the speci?c standard of the G?t?. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord ?r? K???a. The topics discussed by Dh?tar???ra and Sa�jaya, as described in the Mah?bh?rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battle?eld of Kuruk?etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind. The word dharma-k?etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is signi?cant because, on the Battle?eld of Kuruk?etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh?tar???ra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons� ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa�jaya, �What did they do?� He was con?dent that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother P???u were assembled in that Field of Kuruk?etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is signi?cant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battle?eld. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk?etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship � even for the denizens of heaven � Dh?tar???ra became very fearful about the in?uence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would in?uence Arjuna and the sons of P???u favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa�jaya was a student of Vy?sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy?sa, Sa�jaya was able to envision the Battle?eld of Kuruk?etra even while he was in the room of Dh?tar???ra. And so, Dh?tar???ra asked him about the situation on the battle?eld. Both the P???avas and the sons of Dh?tar???ra belong to the same family, but Dh?tar???ra�s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P???u from the family heritage. One can thus understand the speci?c position of Dh?tar???ra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P???u. As in the paddy ?eld the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious ?eld of Kuruk?etra, where the father of religion, ?r? K???a, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh?tar???ra�s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi??hira, would be established by the Lord. This is the signi?cance of the words dharma-k?etre and kuru-k?etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.",

The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battle?eld of Kuruk?etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H???ke?a. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhus?dana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V?sudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak?-nandana because He accepted Devak? as His mother; His name is Ya?od?-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya?od? at V?nd?vana; His name is P?rtha-s?rathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H???ke?a because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battle?eld of Kuruk?etra. Arjuna is referred to as Dhana�jaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacri?ces. Similarly, Bh?ma is known as V?kodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi?imba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the P???avas, beginning with the Lord�s, were all very encouraging to the ?ghting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K???a, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune.

As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death.

Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna�s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but he was also crying out of compassion.

If we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satis?ed. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way � namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one�s own senses � then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satis?ed. Arjuna�s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to ?ght. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed on the battle?eld and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory.

Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K???a kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K???a had already killed them before their coming into the battle?eld and that he was only to become an instrument for K???a. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord�s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them.",

      "purport" : "According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: (1) a poison giver, (2) one who sets ?re to the house, (3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, (4) one who plunders riches, (5) one who occupies another�s land, and (6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite be?tting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k?atriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord R?ma was so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord R?ma (r?ma-r?jya), but Lord R?ma never showed any cowardice. R?va?a was an aggressor against R?ma because R?va?a kidnapped R?ma�s wife, S?t?, but Lord R?ma gave him suf?cient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna�s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing pro?table simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna�s addressing of K???a as �M?dhava,� or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also signi?cant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K???a that, as the husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K???a, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.",

Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to C??akya Pa??ita, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the var???rama system. On the failure of such var???rama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population.

The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Param?tm?, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagav?n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K???a. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (1.2.11) this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus: vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva? yaj j�?nam advayam brahmeti param?tmeti bhagav?n iti ?abdyate �The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Param?tm? and Bhagav?n.� These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun�s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun�s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satis?ed by simply understanding the sunshine � its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature � may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Param?tm? feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagav?n feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category. The Sanskrit word bhagav?n is explained by the great authority Par??ara Muni, the father of Vy?sadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagav?n. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K???a can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahm?, Lord ?iva or N?r?ya?a, can possess opulences as fully as K???a. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-sa?hit? by Lord Brahm? himself that Lord K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagav?n, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes: ??vara? parama? k???a? sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha? an?dir ?dir govinda? sarva-k?ra?a-k?ra?am �There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav?n, but K???a is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.� (Brahma-sa?hit? 5.1) In the Bh?gavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but K???a is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand: ete c???a-kal?? pu?sa? k???as tu bhagav?n svayam indr?ri-vy?kula? loka? m??ayanti yuge yuge �All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.� (Bh?g.1.3.28) Therefore, K???a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman. In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna�s lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore K???a expressed His surprise with the word kuta?, �wherefrom.� Such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as ?ryans. The word ?ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Vi??u, or Bhagav?n, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-?ryans. Although Arjuna was a k?atriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to ?ght. This act of cowardice is described as be?tting the non-?ryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord K???a did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.",

      "purport" : "By nature�s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona ?de spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona ?de spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest ?re that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants ?re, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona ?de spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse. Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the B?had-?ra?yaka Upani?ad (3.8.10) the perplexed man is described as follows: yo v? etad ak?ara? g?rgy aviditv?sm?? lok?t praiti sa k?pa?a?. �He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.� This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the br?hma?a, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad ak?ara? g?rgi viditv?sm?l lok?t praiti sa br?hma?a?. The k?pa?as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of �skin disease.� The k?pa?a thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or thek?pa?a thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to ?ght was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K???a, the supreme spiritual master, to make a de?nite solution. He offers himself to K???a as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. K???a is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-g?t?, and Arjuna is the ?rst disciple for understanding theG?t?. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-g?t? is stated in the G?t? itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to K???a as a person, but to �the unborn within K???a.� There is no difference between K???a�s within and without. And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-g?t?.",

      "purport" : "Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord ?r? K???a. He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord K???a. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a spiritual master like K???a. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent K???a conscious is the bona ?de spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is a master in the science of K???a consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master. kib? vipra, kib? ny?s?, ??dra kene naya yei k???a-tattva-vett?, sei �guru� haya �It does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic wisdom], or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life � if he is a master in the science of K???a, he is the perfect and bona ?de spiritual master.� (Caitanya-carit?m?ta, Madhya 8.128) So without being a master in the science of K???a consciousness, no one is a bona ?de spiritual master. It is also said in the Vedic literature: ?a?-karma-nipu?o vipro mantra-tantra-vi??rada? avai??avo gurur na sy?d vai??ava? ?va-paco guru? �A scholarly br?hma?a, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is un?t to become a spiritual master without being a Vai??ava, or expert in the science of K???a consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vai??ava, or K???a conscious.� (Padma Pur??a) The problems of material existence � birth, old age, disease and death � cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult K???a, or the Bhagavad-g?t? and ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam � which constitute the science of K???a � through the bona ?de representative of K???a, the man in K???a consciousness. If economic development and material comforts could drive away one�s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K???a consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be ?nished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking on the moon planet, can also be ?nished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-g?t? con?rms this: k???e pu?ye martya-loka? vi?anti. �When the results of pious activities are ?nished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.� Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation. Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of K???a, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K???a to solve his problem de?nitely, and that is the way of K???a consciousness.",

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord�s eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone. The M?y?v?d? theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of m?y?, or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K???a, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K???a clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is con?rmed in theUpani?ads, will continue eternally. This statement of K???a�s is authoritative because K???a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then K???a would not have stressed it so much � even for the future. The M?y?v?d? may argue that the individuality spoken of by K???a is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K???a�s individuality? K???a af?rms His individuality in the past and con?rms His individuality in the future also. He has con?rmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K???a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then HisBhagavad-g?t? has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The G?t? is above such literature. No mundane book compares with theBhagavad-g?t?. When one accepts K???a as an ordinary man, the G?t? loses all importance. The M?y?v?d? argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K???a to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus con?rmed by great ?c?ryas like ?r? R?m?nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G?t? that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona ?de access to the great literature. The nondevotee�s approach to the teachings of the G?t? is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of theBhagavad-g?t? can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G?t? be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M?y?v?d? explanation of the G?t? is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M?y?v?d?s and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M?y?v?d? philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the G?t?. If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is con?rmed by the Vedas as above mentioned.",

      "purport" : "Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul ?nally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth � either material or spiritual � there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bh??ma nor for Dro?a, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one�s work in life. So Bh??ma and Dro?a, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation. Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature � both material and spiritual � is called a dh?ra, or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The M?y?v?d? theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul�s being unchangeable. As con?rmed in the G?t?,the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (san?tana) and are called k?ara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the same � fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of re?ection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Param?tm?. He is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is re?ected in water, the re?ections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead ?r? K???a. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with K???a, and K???a is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (m?y?), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of m?y?, no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K???a is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by m?y?.",

      "purport" : "There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist. In the Vi??u Pur??a(2.12.38) it is stated that Vi??u and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence (jyot???i vi??ur bhuvan?ni vi??u?). The words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter. That is the version of all seers of truth. This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the in?uence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole. In the Ved?nta-s?tras, as well as in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and the energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-g?t? for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time.",

      "purport" : "This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one�s own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul�s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The ?vet??vatara Upani?ad (5.9) con?rms this: b?l?gra-?ata-bh?gasya ?atadh? kalpitasya ca bh?go j?va? sa vij�eya? sa c?nanty?ya kalpate �When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.� Similarly the same version is stated: ke??gra-?ata-bh?gasya ?at???a? s?d???tmaka? j?va? s?k?ma-svar?po �ya? sa?khy?t?to hi cit-ka?a? �There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.� Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the in?uence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the in?uence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mu??aka Upani?ad(3.1.9) the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained: e?o �?ur ?tm? cetas? veditavyo yasmin pr??a? pa�cadh? sa?vive?a pr??ai? citta? sarvam ota? praj?n?? yasmin vi?uddhe vibhavaty e?a ?tm? �The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is ?oating in the ?ve kinds of air (pr??a, ap?na, vy?na, sam?na and ud?na), is situated within the heart, and spreads its in?uence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is puri?ed from the contamination of the ?ve kinds of material air, its spiritual in?uence is exhibited.� The ha?ha-yoga system is meant for controlling the ?ve kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures � not for any material pro?t, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere. So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading vi??u-tattva. The in?uence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the Mu??aka Upani?ad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is de?nitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body. Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabh?, or superior energy. So whether one follows Vedic knowledge or modern science, one cannot deny the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-g?t? by the Personality of Godhead Himself.",

The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized.

      "purport" : "Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or k??a-stha. The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother�s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval � that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul�s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body. In the Ka?ha Upani?ad (1.2.18) we also ?nd a similar passage, which reads: na j?yate mriyate v? vipa?cin n?ya? kuta?cin na babh?va ka?cit ajo nitya? ???vato �ya? pur??o na hanyate hanyam?ne ?ar?re The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g?t?, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipa?cit, which means learned or with knowledge. The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not ?nd the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not ?nd the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies � whether man or animal � we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge � past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K???a. But K???a is not like the forgetful soul. If so, K???a�s teachings of Bhagavad-g?t?would be useless. There are two kinds of souls � namely the minute particle soul (a?u-?tm?) and the Supersoul (vibhu-?tm?). This is also con?rmed in the Ka?ha Upani?ad (1.2.20) in this way: a?or a??y?n mahato mah?y?n ?tm?sya jantor nihito guh?y?m tam akratu? pa?yati v?ta-?oko dh?tu? pras?d?n mahim?nam ?tmana? �Both the Supersoul [Param?tm?] and the atomic soul [?j?v?tm?] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.� K???a is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by K???a, or by His bona ?de representative (the spiritual master).",

Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed, because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice. In Manu-sa?hit?, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king�s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually bene?cial. Similarly, when K???a orders ?ghting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of ?ghting for K???a, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him.

Even the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a previous verse (2.13). Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul ful?lls the desire of the atomic soul as one friend ful?lls the desire of another. The Vedas, like theMu??aka Upani?ad, as well as the ?vet??vatara Upani?ad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (K???a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds � although they are the same in quality � one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K???a is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one�s changing his position from one tree to another, or from one body to another. The j?va soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master � as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto K???a for instruction � the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Mu??aka Upani?ad (3.1.2) and ?vet??vatara Upani?ad (4.7) con?rm this: sam?ne v?k?e puru?o nimagno �n??ay? ?ocati muhyam?na? ju??a? yad? pa?yaty anyam ??am asya mahim?nam iti v?ta-?oka? �Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend the Lord and knows His glories � at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.� Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, K???a, and is understanding the Bhagavad-g?t? from Him. And thus, hearing from K???a, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation. Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous ?ght so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacri?cial altar, or in the proper battle?eld, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life.

The M?y?v?d? cannot explain how the individual soul came into existence simply by ignorance and consequently became covered by the illusory energy. Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Supreme Soul; rather, the individual souls are eternally separated parts of the Supreme Soul. Because they are atomic individual souls eternally (san?tana), they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a ?re, although one in quality with the ?re, are prone to be extinguished when out of the ?re. In the Var?ha Pur??a, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-g?t?also.

      "purport" : "There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord K???a spoke the Bhagavad-g?t?, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lok?yatikas and Vaibh??ikas. Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions � now becoming fashionable in America � are also adhering to this philosophy, as are the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects. Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul � as in the Vaibh??ika philosophy � there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scienti?c warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibh??ika philosophy, the so-called soul or ?tm?vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such incidents. If there were no rebirth for the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected by sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K???a sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mah?-b?hu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibh??ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a k?atriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.",

Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument�s sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, ?re is generated; from ?re, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested � that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference. And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-g?t? that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (antavanta ime deh??) but that the soul is eternal (nityasyokt?? ?ar?ri?a?), then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of ?ying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body.

      "purport" : "According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sa?khy? means that which describes things in detail, and s??khyarefers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna�s proposal not to ?ght was based on sense grati?cation. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease ?ghting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh?tar???ra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense grati?cation. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense grati?cation, even at a sacri?ce of wisdom and duty. K???a, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K???a. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as S??khya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This S??khya has nothing to do with the S??khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila�s S??khya, the S??khya philosophy was expounded in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K???a, who explained it to His mother, Devah?ti. It is clearly explained by Him that thepuru?a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prak?ti. This is accepted in theVedas and in the G?t?. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prak?ti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense grati?cation, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare ofm?y?, or sense grati?catory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense grati?catory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V?sudeva, Lord K???a, thereby ful?lling the search after the ultimate truth. Arjuna has already accepted K???a as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: ?i?yas te �ha? ??dhi m?? tv?? prapannam. Consequently, K???a will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, orkarma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense grati?cation of the Lord. Thisbuddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Param?tm? in everyone�s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in K???a consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God. Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word S??khya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic s??khya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the s??khya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic S??khya. Nor did that philosophy have any in?uence during that time; nor would Lord K???a care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real S??khya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, but even that S??khya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, S??khya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K???a made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K???a�s S??khya and Lord Kapila�s S??khya, as described in the Bh?gavatam, are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. Lord K???a said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between s??khya-yoga and bhakti-yoga (s??khya-yogau p?thag b?l?? pravadanti na pa??it??). Of course, atheistic s??khya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistics??khya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-g?t?. One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K???a consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however dif?cult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and ?nds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K???a consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense grati?cation for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.",

      "purport" : "Activity in K???a consciousness, or acting for the bene?t of K???a without expectation of sense grati?cation, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity ?nds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in K???a consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not ?nished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K???a consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K???a consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no pro?t. Aj?mila performed his duty in some percentage of K???a consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (1.5.17): tyaktv? sva-dharma? cara??mbuja? harer bhajann apakvo �tha patet tato yadi yatra kva v?bhadram abh?d amu?ya ki? ko v?rtha ?pto �bhajat?? sva-dharmata? �If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in K???a consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?� Or, as the Christians say, �What pro?teth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffer the loss of his eternal soul?� Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in K???a consciousness carries a person again to K???a consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured br?hma?a or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation.

When one is engaged in the duties of K???a consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one�s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in K???a consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in K???a consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K???a consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive K???a consciousness. The resolute purpose of a person in K???a consciousness is based on knowledge. V?sudeva? sarvam iti sa mah?tm? su-durlabha?: a person in K???a consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that V?sudeva, or K???a, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in K???a consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone � namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If K???a is satis?ed by one�s actions, then everyone will be satis?ed. Service in K???a consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona ?de representative of K???a, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K???a consciousness. As such, to be well versed in K???a consciousness one has to act ?rmly and obey the representative of K???a, and one should accept the instruction of the bona ?de spiritual master as one�s mission in life. ?r?la Vi?van?tha Cakravart? ?h?kura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows: yasya pras?d?d bhagavat-pras?do yasy?pras?d?n na gati? kuto �pi dhy?yan stuva?s tasya ya?as tri-sandhya? vande guro? ?r?-cara??ravindam �By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satis?ed. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of K???a consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.� The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body � not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer a chance for sense grati?cation manifested in fruitive activities.

All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement.

      "purport" : "The rituals and sacri?ces mentioned in the karma-k???a division of the Vedic literature are meant to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g?t? (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K???a, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K???a and one�s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with K???a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g?t? (15.7). The living entities are parts and parcels of K???a; therefore, revival of K???a consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is con?rmed in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (3.33.7) as follows: aho bata ?va-paco �to gar?y?n yaj-jihv?gre vartate n?ma tubhyam tepus tapas te juhuvu? sasnur ?ry? brahm?n?cur n?ma g??anti ye te �O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a ca???la [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacri?ces according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the ?ryan family.� So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense grati?cation. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of the Ved?nta and the Upani?ads thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prak???nanda Sarasvat?, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved?nta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K???a. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Ved?nta philosophy; the best purpose of Ved?nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. Ved?nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Ved?nta philosophy is Lord K???a; and the highest Ved?ntist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.",

Prescribed duties are activities enjoined in terms of one�s acquired modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one�s prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions. As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be ?tted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work performed as an obligation in terms of the scriptural injunctions, without desire for results, is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation. Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to ?ght as a matter of duty without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful.

One has to become the servant of K???a, or the servant of the servant of K???a. That is the right way to discharge duty in K???a consciousness, which alone can help one to act in yoga. Arjuna is a k?atriya, and as such he is participating in the var???rama-dharma institution. It is said in the Vi??u Pur??a that in the var???rama-dharma, the whole aim is to satisfy Vi??u.

He is called pra??nta-ni??e?a-mano-rath?ntara (Stotra-ratna 43), or one who has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord ?r? K???a, or V?sudeva, is everything (v?sudeva? sarvam iti sa mah?tm? su-durlabha?). He is called a muni ?xed in mind. Such a fully K???a conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord�s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not in?uenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one�s own sense grati?cation, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one ?xed in K???a consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord.

And, of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very dif?cult to control the mind and senses without being fully K???a conscious. Without engaging the mind in K???a, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by ?r?

On the other hand, the king, although not as powerful a yog? as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage�s injustices and thereby emerged victorious.

The so-called yog?s who meditate on something other than the Vi??u form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria.

Their so-called renunciation is called phalgu, or less important. On the other hand, a person in K???a consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that K???a is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called pras?dam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized, and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takespras?dam in K???a consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his arti?cial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence.

The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yog?s who are after mystic powers are all unhappy because of unful?lled desires.

A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K???a (???v?syam ida? sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything.

It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha?v??ga Mah?r?ja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K???a. Nirv??a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-g?t? teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is suf?cient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K???a conscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirv??a. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense grati?cation, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K???a consciousness. Attainment of K???a consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K???a consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God. Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore br?hm? sthiti means �not on the platform of material activities.� Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the Bhagavad-g?t? as the liberated stage (sa gu??n samat?tyait?n brahma-bh?y?ya kalpate). Therefore, br?hm? sthiti is liberation from material bondage. ?r?la Bhaktivinoda ?h?kura has summarized this Second Chapter of the Bhagavad-g?t? as being the contents for the whole text.

Sometimes K???a consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K???a conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K???a. But without being trained in the philosophy of K???a consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of K???a in a secluded place, where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K???a consciousness orbuddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the ?ghting by using K???a consciousness as an excuse.

In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. S??khya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in K???a consciousness, as it is explained in the sixty-first verse of the Second Chapter.

The same principle is more clearly explained in the sixty-first verse � that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more speci?cally, on K???a), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K???a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K???a consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-g?t?. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of K???a consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting everything with K???a in K???a consciousness. Of these two, the path of K???a consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process.

In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yaj�as or directly serves Lord Vi??u.

Any other work done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K???a consciousness to satisfy K???a (or Vi??u); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K???a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K???a Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense grati?cation, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K???a.

      "purport" : "The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vi??u) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home � back to Godhead. All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Vi??u, or K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g?t?: vedai? ca sarvair aham eva vedya?. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said:pati? vi?vasy?tme?varam. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi??u. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam also (2.4.20) ?r?la ?ukadeva Gosv?m? describes the Lord as pati in so many ways: ?riya? patir yaj�a-pati? praj?-patir dhiy?? patir loka-patir dhar?-pati? patir gati? c?ndhaka-v???i-s?tvat?? pras?dat?? me bhagav?n sat?? pati? The praj?-pati is Lord Vi??u, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to performyaj�as (sacri?ces) for the satisfaction of Vi??u, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety, and after ?nishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj�a, the conditioned souls gradually become K???a conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the sa?k?rtana-yaj�a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa?k?rtana-yaj�a and K???a consciousness go well together. Lord K???a in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (11.5.32) as follows, with special reference to the sa?k?rtana-yaj�a: k???a-var?a? tvi??k???a? s??gop??g?stra-p?r?adam yaj�ai? sa?k?rtana-pr?yair yajanti hi su-medhasa? �In this Age of Kali, people who are endowed with suf?cient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of sa?k?rtana-yaj�a.� Other yaj�as prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this Age of Kali, but the sa?k?rtana-yaj�a is easy and sublime for all purposes, as recommended in Bhagavad-g?t? also (9.14).",

In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yaj�asprescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacri?ce to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yaj�as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis � namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K?l?, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacri?ce of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Vi??u is recommended. But ultimately all yaj�as are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least ?ve yaj�as, known as pa�ca-mah?-yaj�a, are necessary. One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life � none of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials � all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves ?t and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yaj�as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense grati?cation and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense grati?cation; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yaj�as.

      "purport" : "?r?la Baladeva Vidy?bh??a?a, a great commentator on the Bhagavad-g?t?, writes as follows: ye indr?dy-a?gatay?vasthita? yaj�a? sarve?vara? vi??um abhyarcya tac-che?am a?nanti tena tad deha-y?tr?? samp?dayanti, te santa? sarve?varasya yaj�a-puru?asya bhakt?? sarva-kilbi?air an?di-k?la-viv?ddhair ?tm?nubhava-pratibandhakair nikhilai? p?pair vimucyante. The Supreme Lord, who is known as the yaj�a-puru?a, or the personal bene?ciary of all sacri?ces, is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra and Varu?a are appointed of?cers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacri?ces to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water suf?ciently to produce food grains. When Lord K???a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K???a consciousness, offer food to K???a and then eat � a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi??u and then taken by us makes us suf?ciently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K???a consciousness, who eats only food offered to K???a, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting pras?dam of the Lord (food offered to Vi??u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination. Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and ?esh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the ?eld and not on the production of big factories. The ?eld production is due to suf?cient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satis?ed by sacri?ces; therefore, one who cannot perform them will ?nd himself in scarcity � that is the law of nature. Yaj�a, speci?cally the sa?k?rtana-yaj�a prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.",

The Vedas are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord.

In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one�s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having ?nished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yaj�a by becoming K???a conscious.

To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ?r? K???a. Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacri?ces, are performed for puri?cation of impious activities that were performed in the ?eld of sense grati?cation. But action in K???a consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A K???a conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of K???a alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached.",

The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord.

We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being.

Without such power, one cannot imitate the ??varas, who are superpowerful. Lord ?iva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many pseudo devotees of Lord ?iva who want to indulge in smoking ga�j?(marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord ?iva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some pseudo devotees of Lord K???a who prefer to imitate the Lord in Hisr?sa-l?l?, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill.

That is the real purport of mayi, or �unto Me.� And when one acts in such K???a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or �nothing is mine.� And if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy.

K???a consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence. Therefore, without being fully in K???a consciousness, one should not give up his occupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yog? or transcendentalist arti?cially.

But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. According to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one�s wife. All other women are to be considered as one�s mother. But in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense grati?cation under regulations may also lead one to go astray � as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But attachment to K???a consciousness, or acting always in the loving service of K???a, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities.

Materially, prescribed duties are duties enjoined according to one�s psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service of K???a. But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another�s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a br?hma?a, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas ak?atriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a k?atriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a br?hma?a who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in K???a consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona ?de spiritual master. In that complete stage of K???a consciousness, the k?atriya may act as a br?hma?a, or abr?hma?a may act as a k?atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Vi?v?mitra was originally a k?atriya, but later on he acted as a br?hma?a, whereas Para?ur?ma was abr?hma?a but later on he acted as a k?atriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature.

Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatis?ed, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment. The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to ful?ll these lustful propensities, and when completely baf?ed by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position. This inquiry is the beginning of the Ved?nta-s?tras, wherein it is said, ath?to brahma-jij�?s?: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is de?ned in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam as janm?dy asya yato �nvay?d itarata? ca,or, �The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.� Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into K???a consciousness � or, in other words, desiring everything for K???a � then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanum?n, the great servitor of Lord R?ma, exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of R?va?a, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the Lord. Here also, in Bhagavad-g?t?, the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord.

This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the ?re, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the ?re of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living entity exhibits his K???a consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the ?re covered by smoke. Although ?re is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of ?re in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of K???a consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke-covered ?re is compared to the human being. In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a little K???a consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the ?re of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the ?re, ?re can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence.

Lust is only the perverted re?ection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K???a consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very dif?cult to return to the normal condition.

Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or K???a consciousness. In K???a consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act � as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Ka?ha Upani?adthere is a similar passage, in which it is said that the objects of sense grati?cation are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. Para? d???v? nivartate. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the Ka?ha Upani?ad the soul has been described as mah?n, the great. Therefore the soul is above all � namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem. With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in K???a consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of the senses. But aside from that, one has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one�s mind in K???a consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with K???a in K???a consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.",

      "purport" : "Herein we ?nd the history of the Bhagavad-g?t? traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order of all planets, beginning from the sun planet. The kings of all planets are especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and therefore the royal order should understand the science of Bhagavad-g?t? in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of K???a consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life. In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasv?n, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-sa?hit? (5.52) it is stated: yac-cak?ur e?a savit? sakala-grah???? r?j? samasta-sura-m?rtir a?e?a-tej?? yasy?j�ay? bhramati sambh?ta-k?la-cakro govindam ?di-puru?a? tam aha? bhaj?mi �Let me worship,� Lord Brahm? said, �the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K???a], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.� The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasv?n) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K???a, and Lord K???a originally made Vivasv?n His ?rst disciple to understand the science of Bhagavad-g?t?. The G?t? is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insigni?cant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial. In the Mah?bh?rata (??nti-parva 348.51�52) we can trace out the history of the G?t? as follows: tret?-yug?dau ca tato vivasv?n manave dadau manu? ca loka-bh?ty-artha? sut?yek?v?kave dadau ik?v?ku?? ca kathito vy?pya lok?n avasthita? �In the beginning of the millennium known as Tret?-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasv?n to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mah?r?ja Ik?v?ku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord R?macandra appeared.� Therefore,Bhagavad-g?t? existed in human society from the time of Mah?r?ja Ik?v?ku. At the present moment we have just passed through ?ve thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dv?para-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tret?-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-g?t? to his disciple and son Mah?r?ja Ik?v?ku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the G?t? was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god Vivasv?n, a rough estimate is that the G?t? was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about ?ve thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the G?t?, according to the G?t? itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord ?r? K???a. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasv?n because he is also a k?atriya and is the father of all k?atriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the s?rya-va??a k?atriyas. Because Bhagavad-g?t? is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru?eya,superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the G?t? must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the G?t? in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-g?t? as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-g?t? has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ik?v?ku.",

As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the G?t? appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the G?t? (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, although they make a good business on the words of ?r? K???a. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme.

      "purport" : "Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K???a�s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K???a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K???a. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course, K???a also appeared as the son of Devak? on this earth. How K???a remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very dif?cult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K???a so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K???a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K???a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K???a would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K???a. Therefore, when K???a Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K???a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K???a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K???a when they are spoken by K???a Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K???a because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K???a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K???a is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha � the eternal form of bliss and knowledge � that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the in?uence of time and space. A devotee of K???a, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K???a. Arjuna�s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider K???a to be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature.",

      "purport" : "In the Brahma-sa?hit? (5.33) we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord.

Although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.� It is also stated in Brahma-sa?hit? (5.39): r?m?di-m?rti?u kal?-niyamena ti??han n?n?vat?ram akarod bhuvane?u kintu k???a? svaya? samabhavat parama? pum?n yo govindam ?di-puru?a? tam aha? bhaj?mi �I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K???a], who is always situated in various incarnations such as R?ma, N?si?ha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K???a, and who incarnates personally also.� In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaid?rya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas (vede?u durlabham adurlabham ?tma-bhaktau). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord K???a spoke the Bhagavad-g?t? to the sun-god Vivasv?n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-sa?hit? as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the G?t?cannot be understood by demonic brains. K???a remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K???a and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-?nanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit � whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord�s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.",

      "purport" : "The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past �births,� whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very dif?cult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K???a. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His prak?ti, or His form.Prak?ti means �nature,� as well as svar?pa, or �one�s own form.� The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no ?xed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K???a appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a ?ute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord K???a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk?etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had suf?ciently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-?ve years old. We never see a picture of K???a in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation � past, present and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun�s rising, moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun has set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its ?xed position, but owing to our defective, insuf?cient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord K???a�s appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency � and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also con?rm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also con?rm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In theBh?gavatam, He appears before His mother as N?r?ya?a, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord�s forms to be. The word m?y?, or ?tma-m?y?, refers to the Lord�s causeless mercy, according to the Vi?va-ko?a dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.",

      "purport" : "The word s?j?mi is signi?cant herein. S?j?mi cannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord�s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore, s?j?mi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of the Dv?para-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of Brahm?, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bh?gavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahm?, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharma? tu s?k??d bhagavat-pra??tam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-g?t?. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the G?t?, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears. From the Bh?gavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K???a who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacri?ce for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacri?ce without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avat?ra,or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avat?ra unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same � to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona ?de representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form. The principles of the Bhagavad-g?t? were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner�s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K???a consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.",

      "purport" : "According to Bhagavad-g?t?, a s?dhu (holy man) is a man in K???a consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the quali?cations of K???a consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be as?dhu. And du?k?t?m applies to those who do not care for K???a consciousness. Such miscreants, or du?k?t?m, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in K???a consciousness is accepted as a s?dhu, even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R?va?a and Ka?sa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahl?da Mah?r?ja was the son of Hira?yaka?ipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak?, the mother of K???a, was the sister of Ka?sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K???a was to be born of them. So Lord K???a appeared primarily to deliver Devak? rather than kill Ka?sa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations. In the Caitanya-carit?m?ta of K???ad?sa Kavir?ja, the following verses (Madhya 20.263�264) summarize these principles of incarnation: s???i-hetu yei m?rti prapa�ce avatare sei ??vara-m?rti �avat?ra� n?ma dhare m?y?t?ta paravyome sab?ra avasth?na vi?ve avatari� dhare �avat?ra� n?ma �The avat?ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avat?ra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avat?ra.� There are various kinds of avat?ras, such as puru??vat?ras, gu??vat?ras, l?l?vat?ras, ?akty-?ve?a avat?ras, manvantara-avat?ras and yug?vat?ras � all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K???a is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avat?ras. Lord ?r? K???a descends for the speci?c purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V?nd?vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K???a avat?ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees. The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mah?prabhu, who spread the worship of K???a by the sa?k?rtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread K???a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of sa?k?rtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K???a, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the con?dential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as theUpani?ads, Mah?bh?rata and Bh?gavatam. The devotees of Lord K???a are very much attracted by the sa?k?rtanamovement of Lord Caitanya. This avat?ra of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by His causeless mercy.",

      "purport" : "The Lord�s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the sixth verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yog?s attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve � merging into the impersonalbrahma-jyotir of the Lord � is only partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the Brahma-sa?hit?(5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam an?dim ananta-r?pam.Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the Vedas (Puru?a-bodhin? Upani?ad): eko devo nitya-l?l?nurakto bhakta-vy?p? h?dy antar-?tm? �The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.� This Vedic version is con?rmed in this verse of the G?t? personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version tat tvam asi is actually applied in this case. Anyone who understands Lord K???a to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, �You are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,� is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is con?rmed by the following Vedic assertion: tam eva viditv?ti m?tyum eti n?nya? panth? vidyate �yan?ya �One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no other way to achieve this perfection.� (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 3.8) That there is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-g?t? according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed-up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate K???a consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection.",

      "purport" : "As described above, it is very dif?cult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona ?de spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bh?va, or transcendental love of Godhead. According to Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu (1.4.15�16), the science of devotional service: ?dau ?raddh? tata? s?dhu- sa?go �tha bhajana-kriy? tato �nartha-niv?tti? sy?t tato ni??h? rucis tata? ath?saktis tato bh?vas tata? prem?bhyuda�cati s?dhak?n?m aya? prem?a? pr?durbh?ve bhavet krama? �In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, ?r? K???a. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for K???a consciousness, which is matured in bh?va, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called prema, the highest perfectional stage of life.� In the prema stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona ?de spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one�s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.",

      "purport" : "Everyone is searching for K???a in the different aspects of His manifestations. K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal brahma-jyotir effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But K???a is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, K???a is the object of everyone�s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satis?ed according to one�s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K???a reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K???a as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son and still another as his lover. K???a rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K???a helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not ?rmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material ?eld to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the yaj�e?vara; and those who are yog?s seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K???a consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (2.3.10): ak?ma? sarva-k?mo v? mok?a-k?ma ud?ra-dh?? t?vre?a bhakti-yogena yajeta puru?a? param �Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive results or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection, culminating in K???a consciousness.�",

      "purport" : "There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God�s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nity?n?m: God is one. ??vara? parama? k???a?. The Supreme God is one � K???a � and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nity?n?m) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God � N?r?ya?a, Vi??u, or K???a. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or p??a???. Even the great demigods like Brahm? and ?iva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm? and ?iva (?iva-viri�ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devat?? denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But N?r?ya?a, Vi??u, or K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even ?r?p?da ?a?kar?c?rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that N?r?ya?a, or K???a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (h?ta-j�?na) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K???a consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary bene?t. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or �big guns� in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K???a consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worshiping empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in K???a consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.",

      "purport" : "The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called br?hma?as due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the k?atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vai?yas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the ??dras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord K???a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K???a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K???a consciousness, however, is above even thebr?hma?as. Although br?hma?as by quality are supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K???a. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a br?hma?a and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord ?r? K???a, becomes a person in K???a consciousness � or, in other words, a Vai??ava. K???a consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of K???a, namely R?ma, N?si?ha, Var?ha, etc. And as K???a is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in K???a consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.",

He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense grati?cation, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense grati?cation, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm?ti con?rms this fact as follows: nimitta-m?tram ev?sau s?jy?n?? sarga-karma?i pradh?na-k?ra??-bh?t? yato vai s?jya-?aktaya? �In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made visible.� The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the Ved?nta-s?tra (2.1.34) it is con?rmed, vai?amya-nairgh??ye na s?pek?atv?t: the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K???a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions.

Why such action should not be independent will be explained in the text to follow. To act in K???a consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter. The system of K???a consciousness was ?rst narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ik?v?ku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of K???a consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in K???a consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered. It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself. Dharma? tu s?k??d bhagavat-pra??tam (Bh?g.6.3.19). No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahm?, ?iva, N?rada, Manu, the Kum?ras, Kapila, Prahl?da, Bh??ma, ?ukadeva Gosv?m?, Yamar?ja, Janaka and Bali Mah?r?ja. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K???a consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.",

      "purport" : "How activities in K???a consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in K???a consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of K???a consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K???a consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K???a consciousness as set forth here in the G?t?. This process is generally known as yaj�a, or activities (sacri?ces) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi??u, or K???a. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K???a consciousness, or for Vi??u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The word brahma (Brahman) means �spiritual.� The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahma-jyotir, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahma-jyotir, but when thejyotir is covered by illusion (m?y?) or sense grati?cation, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K???a consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K???a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor and the result are � all combined together � Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by m?y? is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K???a consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K???a consciousness, it is said to be in sam?dhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaj�a, or sacri?ce for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance and the result or ultimate gain � everything � becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K???a consciousness.",

But there are others also, who perform similar sacri?ces in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacri?ce to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacri?ces in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacri?ce by different types of performers only super?cially demark varieties of sacri?ce. Factually sacri?ce means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi??u, who is also known as Yaj�a. All the different varieties of sacri?ce can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacri?ce of worldly possessions and sacri?ce in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in K???a consciousness sacri?ce all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacri?ce their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacri?ce their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material bene?ts worship the demigods by various sacri?ces according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-??vara-v?d?, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacri?ce their individual selves in the supreme ?re and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacri?ce their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacri?ce their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacri?ces his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the ?re altar of sacri?ce is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the ?re of Brahman. The K???a conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacri?ces everything for the satisfaction of K???a, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self � everything � is sacri?ced for K???a.

There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Pata�jali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or ha?ha-yoga or a????ga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sancti?ed places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yaj�a, sacri?ce for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, speci?cally theUpani?ads and Ved?nta-s?tras, or the S??khya philosophy. All of these are called sv?dhy?ya-yaj�a, or engagement in the sacri?ce of studies. All these yog?s are faithfully engaged in different types of sacri?ce and are seeking a higher status of life. K???a consciousness, however, is different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. K???a consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacri?ce but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona ?de devotees. Therefore, K???a consciousness is transcendental.",

      "purport" : "This system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pr???y?ma, and in the beginning it is practiced in the ha?ha-yoga system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the directions of their passage. The ap?na air goes downward, and the pr??a air goes up. Thepr???y?ma-yog? practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into p?raka, equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath into the inhaled breath is called recaka. When both air currents are completely stopped, one is said to be in kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, one can increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization. The intelligent yog? is interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting for the next. For by practicing kumbhaka-yoga, the yog?s increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K???a conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of K???a, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord K???a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in Bhagavad-g?t? (14.26): m?? ca yo �vyabhic?re?a bhakti-yogena sevate sa gu??n samat?tyait?n brahma-bh?y?ya kalpate �One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord transcends the modes of material nature and is immediately elevated to the spiritual platform.� A K???a conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only k???a-pras?dam, or food which is offered ?rst to the Lord.

In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one�s dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense grati?cation and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacri?ce recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of yaj�a we can have enough food, enough milk, etc. � even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense grati?cation. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yaj�a (sacri?ce), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yaj�a according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life even in this body, and what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds ofyaj�a. But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of K???a consciousness.

Sacri?ces sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer.

The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona ?de spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona ?de spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The Bh?gavatam(6.3.19) says, dharma? tu s?k??d bhagavat-pra??tam: the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona ?de spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona ?de spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple.

      "purport" : "The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord ?r? K???a. The sense of an existence separate from K???a is called m?y? (m? � not, y? � this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K???a, that K???a is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g?t?, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K???a. K???a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-sa?hit? it is clearly stated that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K???a. The M?y?v?d? philosophers wrongly think that K???a loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the M?y?v?d? philosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world. For want of suf?cient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K???a. Although we are separated parts of K???a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is m?y?, or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy K???a. Bym?y? alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K???a. The whole teaching of the G?t? is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as K???a�s eternal servitor, cannot be separated from K???a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K???a is called m?y?. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to ful?ll. Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K???a consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona ?de spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K???a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K???a, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K???a. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K???a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as con?rmed in the Bh?gavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitv?nyath?-r?pa? svar?pe?a vyavasthiti?.

      "purport" : "The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called san?tana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of sacri?cial actions: one is called sacri?ce of one�s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacri?ce of one�s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacri?ce becomes material. But one who performs such sacri?ces with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacri?ce. When we come to spiritual activities, we ?nd that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one�s own self (or one�s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of Bhagavad-g?t? as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no dif?culty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is bene?cial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the G?t? is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K???a consciousness. K???a consciousness is awakened by different types of sacri?ces to the demigods, sacri?ce to Brahman, sacri?ce in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying theVedas and in partaking of the social institution called var???rama-dharma. All of these are known as sacri?ce, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-g?t?, but one who doubts the authority of K???a falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-g?t?, or any other scripture, under a bona ?de spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona ?de spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-g?t? have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-g?t? as it is expressed in the G?t? itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is de?nitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of Bhagavad-g?t?. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge.",

Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacri?cial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and ?ght, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K???a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sanny?sa,or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether or work with full knowledge.",

      "purport" : "Fruitive activities (seeking sense grati?cation) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (5.5.4�6) con?rms this as follows: n?na? pramatta? kurute vikarma yad indriya-pr?taya ?p??oti na s?dhu manye yata ?tmano �yam asann api kle?a-da ?sa deha? par?bhavas t?vad abodha-j?to y?van na jij�?sata ?tma-tattvam y?vat kriy?s t?vad ida? mano vai karm?tmaka? yena ?ar?ra-bandha? eva? mana? karma-va?a? prayu?kte avidyay?tmany upadh?yam?ne pr?tir na y?van mayi v?sudeve na mucyate deha-yogena t?vat �People are mad after sense grati?cation, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one�s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense grati?cation is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real identity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for fruitive results for sense grati?cation, and as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense grati?cation one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and in?uenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to V?sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence.� Therefore, j�?na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not suf?cient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K???a consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one�s advancement in real knowledge. Without K???a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not puri?ed, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K???a consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore action in K???a consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K???a consciousness is incomplete, as is con?rmed by ?r?la R?pa Gosv?m? in his Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu (1.2.258): pr?pa�cikatay? buddhy? hari-sambandhi-vastuna? mumuk?ubhi? parity?go vair?gya? phalgu kathyate �When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their renunciation is called incomplete.� Renunciation is complete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is K???a�s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K???a, everything should be employed in the service of K???a.

Even one�s material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K???a consciousness. It is then beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the G?t? (3.30),mayi sarv??i karm??i sannyasya: �Resign all works unto Me [K???a].� The conclusion is that a person without K???a consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in K???a consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of K???a and should therefore be engaged in the service of K???a.",

      "purport" : "The Sanskrit word vibhu means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satis?ed in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be in?uenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is a?u, or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is ful?lled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to ful?ll those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identi?es himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Param?tm?, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the ?avor of a ?ower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity. The Lord ful?lls his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in ful?lling his desires. The Lord, however, can ful?ll all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities. However, when one desires K???a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, e?a u hy eva s?dhu karma k?rayati ta? yam ebhyo lokebhya unnin??ate. e?a u ev?s?dhu karma k?rayati yam adho nin??ate: �The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so that he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so that he may go to hell.� (Kau??tak? Upani?ad 3.8) aj�o jantur an??o �yam ?tmana? sukha-du?khayo? ??vara-prerito gacchet svarga? v??v abhram eva ca �The living entity is completely dependent in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.� Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K???a consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. TheVed?nta-s?tras (2.1.34) also con?rm this. Vai?amya-nairgh??ye na s?pek?atv?t tath? hi dar?ayati: �The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to.�",

It is stated in the Bhagavad-g?t?, sarva? j�?na-plavena, j�?n?gni? sarva-karm??i and na hi j�?nena sad??am. Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K???a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, nineteenth verse: bah?n?? janman?m ante j�?nav?n m?? prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K???a, or when one attains K???a consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K???a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona ?de spiritual master and, under him, learn what K???a consciousness is, for K???a consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona ?de K???a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one�s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord ?r? K???a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge.",

      "purport" : "Being engaged in K???a consciousness, one can immediately understand one�s spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, quali?ed to feel the presence of the Lord in the sphere of one�s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme. After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of the mysticism or yoga known as a????ga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, ?sana, pr???y?ma, praty?h?ra, dh?ra??, dhy?na and sam?dhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the praty?h?raprocess in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half-closed lids. There is no bene?t in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there bene?t in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up-moving and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme. This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In other words, K???a consciousness is the easiest process of executingyoga principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A K???a conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of controlling the senses than by a????ga-yoga.",

      "purport" : "The conditioned souls within the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g?t?. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K???a is the bene?ciary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord ?iva and Lord Brahm?. In the Vedas (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as tam ??var???? parama? mahe?vara?.Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of K???a consciousness: Lord K???a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K???a consciousness. This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K???a consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K???a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K???a consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j�?na-yoga is a path leading tobhakti-yoga. K???a consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one�s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K???a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact withm?y? (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m?y?, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K???a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one�s practical performance of duties in K???a consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the in?uence of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in K???a consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahma-nirv??a. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K???a consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, ?sana, pr???y?ma, praty?h?ra, dh?ra??, dhy?na and sam?dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K???a Consciousness.",

However, this is very dif?cult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in K???a consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal grati?cation, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K???a consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K???a consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sanny?s?, the perfect yog?. The sanny?s?s sometimes arti?cially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj�as (?re sacri?ces), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog? who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K???a consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K???a conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K???a, and thus he is the perfect sanny?s?, or perfect yog?. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way: na dhana? na jana? na sundar?? kavit?? v? jagad-??a k?maye mama janmani janman??vare bhavat?d bhaktir ahaituk? tvayi �O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women.

This is practiced by the yog?s who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K???a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K???a. Therefore, a K???a conscious person is simultaneously a sanny?s? and a yog?. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j�?na and yoga processes, is automatically served in K???a consciousness.

It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the in?uence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K???a consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this.

      "purport" : "K???a is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Param?tm? and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K???a consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially K???a conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K???a and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K???a. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K???a conscious. A directly K???a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and Param?tm?. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog? are imperfectly K???a conscious. Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The ?rst business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K???a. One should always think of K???a and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam?dhi, or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness. All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K???a consciousness, because direct K???a consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. ?r?la R?pa Gosv?m? characterizes K???a consciousness in this way: an?saktasya vi?ay?n, yath?rham upayu�jata? nirbandha? k???a-sambandhe, yukta? vair?gyam ucyate pr?pa�cikatay? buddhy? hari-sambandhi-vastuna? mumuk?ubhi? parity?go vair?gya? phalgu kathyate �When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K???a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to K???a is not as complete in his renunciation.� (Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu 1.2.255�256) A K???a conscious person well knows that everything belongs to K???a, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of K???a consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to K???a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in K???a consciousness. Therefore a person in K???a consciousness is the perfect yog?.",

      "purport" : "The goal of life is to know K???a, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Param?tm?, the four-handed Vi??u form. The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Vi??u, and not for any other purpose. The localized vi??u-m?rti is the plenary representation of K???a dwelling within one�s heart. One who has no program to realize this vi??u-m?rti is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. K???a is the ultimate goal of life, and the vi??u-m?rti situated in one�s heart is the object of yogapractice. To realize this vi??u-m?rti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yog?. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense grati?cation, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Y?j�avalkya it is said: karma?? manas? v?c? sarv?vasth?su sarvad? sarvatra maithuna-ty?go brahmacarya? pracak?ate �The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind � at all times, under all circumstances and in all places.� No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood, when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of ?ve are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmac?r?s. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga,whether it be dhy?na, j�?na or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a brahmac?r?. Such a restrained householder brahmac?r? may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the j�?na and dhy?na schools do not even admit householder brahmac?r?s. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmac?r? is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g?t?(2.59) it is said: vi?ay? vinivartante nir?h?rasya dehina? rasa-varja? raso �py asya para? d???v? nivartate Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense grati?cation, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste. Vigata-bh??. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in K???a consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K???a. The Bh?gavatam (11.2.37) says,bhaya? dvit?y?bhinive?ata? sy?d ???d apetasya viparyayo �sm?ti?. K???a consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is K???a conscious.

Yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yog? according to Bhagavad-g?t?. Nor does cessation of material existence entail one�s entering into �the void,� which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-g?t? as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para? dh?ma, or superior abodes. A consummate yog?, who is perfect in understanding Lord K???a, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (mat-citta?, mat-para?, mat-sth?nam), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, K???aloka, known as Goloka V?nd?vana.

No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaiku??ha) or enter into the Lord�s eternal abode (Goloka V?nd?vana) without the proper understanding of K???a and His plenary expansion Vi??u. Therefore a person working in K???a consciousness is the perfect yog?, because his mind is always absorbed in K???a�s activities (sa vai mana? k???a-pad?ravindayo?).

(9.26), vegetables, ?owers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in K???a consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K???a conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in K???a consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. Avyartha-k?latvam: a K???a conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is ?r?la R?pa Gosv?m?, who was always engaged in the service of K???a and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. ?h?kura Harid?sa would not even accept pras?dam nor even sleep for a moment without ?nishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a K???a conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with K???a�s interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense grati?cation. Since there is no question of sense grati?cation, there is no material leisure for a person in K???a consciousness.

      "purport" : "By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or sam?dhi, which means that the yog? realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Pata�jali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pata�jali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Pata�jali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure � realized through transcendental senses � is accepted. And this is corroborated by Pata�jali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-s?tras (4.33): puru??rtha-??ny?n?? gu??n?? pratiprasava? kaivalya? svar?pa-prati??h? v? citi-?aktir iti. This citi-?akti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru??rtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense grati?cation and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This �oneness with the Supreme� is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pata�jali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpa?a-m?rjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This �clearance� is actually liberation, or bhava-mah?-d?v?gni-nirv?pa?am. The theory of nirv??a � also preliminary � corresponds with this principle. In the Bh?gavatam (2.10.6) this is called svar?pe?a vyavasthiti?.The Bhagavad-g?t? also con?rms this situation in this verse. After nirv??a, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as K???a consciousness. In the words of the Bh?gavatam, svar?pe?a vyavasthiti?: this is the �real life of the living entity.� M?y?, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pata�jali also accepts this by his words kaivalya? svar?pa-prati??h? v? citi-?aktir iti. This citi-?akti, or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is con?rmed in the Ved?nta-s?tra (1.1.12) as ?nanda-mayo �bhy?s?t. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g?t?. In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of sam?dhi, called sampraj�?ta-sam?dhi andasampraj�?ta-sam?dhi. When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, he is said to have achieved sampraj�?ta-sam?dhi. In the asampraj�?ta-sam?dhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yog? is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yog? is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today�s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yog? indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yog?s who are attracted by thesiddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If yog?s are attracted by the by-products ofyoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way. The best practice of yoga in this age is K???a consciousness, which is not baf?ing. A K???a conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing ha?ha-yoga, dhy?na-yoga and j�?na-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga. As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga, or in K???a consciousness, does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in K???a consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences � such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative � but he is always alert to execute his duties in K???a consciousness, or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in theBhagavad-g?t? (2.14), ?gam?p?yino �nity?s t??s titik?asva bh?rata. He endures all such incidental occurrences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.",

Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest dif?culty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.",

One should be sure of success at the end and pursue this course with great perseverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any delay in the attainment of success.

A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu?a, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi??u, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu?a was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garu?a at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu?a. Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in K???a consciousness, may appear to be a very dif?cult job.

Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for a worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more dif?cult to capture the turbulent mind.

In the present age no one can observe the strict rules and regulations of placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K???a consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The ?rst and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about K???a. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about K???a, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from K???a. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn vair?gya. Vair?gya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more dif?cult than attaching the mind to the activities of K???a. This is practical because by hearing about K???a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called pare??nubhava, spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord K???a is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to K???a is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient.

The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K???a consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord K???a to con?rm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very dif?cult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for many reasons. First of all, one may not be suf?ciently serious about following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yog?c calita-m?nasa?: deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.",

On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.� For material prospects there are many activities, both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K???a consciousness. One may argue that by K???a consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh?gavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K???a consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K???a consciousness. The purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense grati?cations without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classi?ed amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually to K???a consciousness, certainly progress in life. Those who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to ?nd ultimate liberation from material existence, and (3) those who are devotees in K???a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense grati?cation. Those who are after fruitive results for sense grati?cation may be elevated to a higher standard of life � even to the higher planets � but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in K???a consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of K???a consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate realization of K???a consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.",

      "purport" : "The word bhajate is signi?cant here. Bhajate has its root in the verb bhaj, which is used when there is need of service. The English word �worship� cannot be used in the same sense as bhaj. Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The Bh?gavatam (11.5.3) con?rms this as follows: ya e??? puru?a? s?k??d ?tma-prabhavam ??varam na bhajanty avaj?nanti sth?n?d bhra???? patanty adha? �Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.� In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word �worship� can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word avaj?nanti, used in this verse of ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g?t?. Avaj?nanti m?? m??h??: �Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K???a.� Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-g?t? without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word �worship.� The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga. All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called j�?na-yoga. When j�?na-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called a????ga-yoga. And when one surpasses the a????ga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K???a, it is calledbhakti-yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog? who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name:karma-yog?, j�?na-yog? or dhy?na-yog?, r?ja-yog?, ha?ha-yog?, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas. Therefore, to become K???a conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Him?layan, we refer to the world�s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination. It is by great fortune that one comes to K???a consciousness on the path of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal yog? concentrates his attention on K???a, who is called ?y?masundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is ?ower-garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called thebrahma-jyotir. He incarnates in different forms such as R?ma, N?si?ha, Var?ha and K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of mother Ya?od?, and He is known as K???a, Govinda and V?sudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest yog?. This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as is con?rmed in all Vedic literature: yasya deve par? bhaktir yath? deve tath? gurau tasyaite kathit? hy arth?? prak??ante mah?tmana? �Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.� (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 6.23) Bhaktir asya bhajana? tad ih?mutrop?dhi-nair?syen?mu?min mana?-kalpanam, etad eva nai?karmyam. �Bhaktimeans devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material pro?t, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose of nai?karmya.� (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad 1.15) These are some of the means for performance of bhakti, or K???a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.

      "purport" : "In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g?t?, the nature of K???a consciousness is fully described. K???a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to K???a and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K???a are described in this chapter. In the ?rst six chapters of Bhagavad-g?t?, the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K???a, or in other words K???a consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one�s mind upon K???a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahma-jyotir or localized Param?tm? realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is partial. Full and scienti?c knowledge is K???a, and everything is revealed to the person in K???a consciousness. In complete K???a consciousness one knows that K???a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of K???a consciousness. One who takes directly to K???a consciousness automatically knows about brahma-jyotir and Param?tm? in full. By practice of K???a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full � namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia. One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K???a the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which?rava?am is the ?rst and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, tac ch??u, or �Hear from Me.� No one can be a greater authority than K???a, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to become a perfectly K???a conscious person. One has therefore to learn from K???a directly or from a pure devotee of K???a � and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam this process of understanding K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows: ???vat?? sva-kath?? k???a? pu?ya-?rava?a-k?rtana? h?dy anta?-stho hy abhadr??i vidhunoti suh?t sat?m na??a-pr?ye?v abhadre?u nitya? bh?gavata-sevay? bhagavaty uttama-?loke bhaktir bhavati nai??hik? tad? rajas-tamo-bh?v?? k?ma-lobh?daya? ca ye ceta etair an?viddha? sthita? sattve pras?dati eva? prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata? bhagavat-tattva-vij�?na? mukta-sa?gasya j?yate bhidyate h?daya-granthi? chidyante sarva-sa??ay?? k??yante c?sya karm??i d???a ev?tman??vare �To hear about K???a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-g?t?, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about K???a, Lord K???a, who is dwelling in everyone�s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and puri?es the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about K???a from the Bh?gavatam and from the devotees, he becomes ?xed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of asa??aya? samagram, understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.� (Bh?g. 1.2.17�21) Therefore only by hearing from K???a or from His devotee in K???a consciousness can one understand the science of K???a.",

      "purport" : "There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands, one may be suf?ciently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The ?rst six chapters of the G?t? are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by j�?na-yoga, dhy?na-yoga and discrimination of the self from matter. However, K???a can be known only by persons who are in K???a consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding K???a. K???a is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Param?tm?. The yog?s and j�?n?s are confused in their attempts to understand K???a. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, ?r?p?da ?a?kar?c?rya, has admitted in his G?t? commentary that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept K???a as such, for it is very dif?cult to know K???a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman. K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. ??vara? parama? k???a? sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha?/ an?dir ?dir govinda? sarva-k?ra?a-k?ra?am. It is very dif?cult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti, or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the dif?cult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. ?r?la R?pa Gosv?m? writes in his Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu (1.2.101): ?ruti-sm?ti-pur???di- pa�car?tra-vidhi? vin? aik?ntik? harer bhaktir utp?t?yaiva kalpate �Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upani?ads, Pur??as andN?rada Pa�car?tra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.� It is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the Param?tm?-realized yog? to understand K???a the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Ya?od? or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K???a (muhyanti yat s?raya?). M?? tu veda na ka?cana: �No one knows Me as I am,� the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then sa mah?tm? su-durlabha?: �Such a great soul is very rare.� Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know K???a as He is (tattvata?), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in K???a � His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation � because K???a is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said: ata? ?r?-k???a-n?m?di na bhaved gr?hyam indriyai? sevonmukhe hi jihv?dau svayam eva sphuraty ada? �No one can understand K???a as He is by the blunt material senses.

      "purport" : "The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies. Material nature is calledprak?ti, or the energy of the Lord in His different puru?a incarnations (expansions) as described in the N?rada Pa�car?tra, one of the S?tvata-tantras: vi??os tu tr??i r?p??i puru??khy?ny atho vidu? eka? tu mahata? sra??? dvit?ya? tv a??a-sa?sthitam t?t?ya? sarva-bh?ta-stha? t?ni j�?tv? vimucyate �For material creation, Lord K???a�s plenary expansion assumes three Vi??us. The ?rst one, Mah?-vi??u, creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodaka-??y? Vi??u, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K??rodaka-??y? Vi??u, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param?tm?. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi??us can be liberated from material entanglement.� This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi??u expansions of Lord K???a. These puru?as are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K???a) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the puru?as � the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to Bhagavad-g?t? this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K???a is the original cause of the material manifestation. ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam also con?rms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahma-jyotir, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in thebrahma-jyotir as there are in the Vaiku??ha-lokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahma-jyotir as the ultimate eternal goal. The Param?tm? manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the K??rodaka-??y? Vi??u. The Param?tm? manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K???a. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies. In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the ?rst ?ve manifestations, namely earth, water, ?re, air and sky, are called the ?ve gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the ?ve sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K???a. The false ego � �I am,� and �It is mine,� which constitute the basic principle of material existence � includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of S??khya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K???a�s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic S??khya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K???a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the S??khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K???a, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g?t?.",

      "purport" : "Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, ?re, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always controlled by the Lord � they have no independent existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (10.87.30) as follows: aparimit? dhruv?s tanu-bh?to yadi sarva-gat?s tarhi na ??syateti niyamo dhruva netarath? ajani ca yan-maya? tad avimucya niyant? bhavet samam anuj?nat?? yad amata? mata-du??atay? �O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a faulty and polluted opinion.� The Supreme Lord, K???a, is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the in?uence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the in?uence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the in?uence of material illusion, thinks, �I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.� His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may conclude that the G?t? con?rms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of K???a; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully K???a conscious, or liberated.",

      "purport" : "There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far asBhagavad-g?t? is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead, ?r? K???a, and this is con?rmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the af?rmation of the Brahma-sa?hit?: ??vara? parama? k???a? sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha?; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K???a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the ?vet??vatara Upani?ad (3.10): tato yad uttara-tara? tad ar?pam an?mayam/ ya etad vidur am?t?s te bhavanti athetare du?kham ev?piyanti. �In the material world Brahm?, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahm? there is the Transcendence, who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.� The impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar?pam. But this ar?pam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-sa?hit? quoted above. Other verses in the ?vet??vatara Upani?ad (3.8�9) substantiate this as follows: ved?ham eta? puru?a? mah?ntam ?ditya-var?a? tamasa? parast?t tam eva viditv?ti m?tyum eti n?nya? panth? vidyate �yan?ya yasm?t para? n?param asti ki�cid yasm?n n???yo no jy?yo �sti ki�cit v?k?a iva stabdho divi ti??haty ekas teneda? p?r?a? puru?e?a sarvam �I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person. �There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person, because He is the supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies.� From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual.",

      "purport" : "This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glori?es the Lord for His kindly supplying tasty water to quench man�s thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no con?ict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya bheda- and abheda-tattva � simultaneous oneness and difference. The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahma-jyotir, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And pra?ava, or the o?-k?ra transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn, addresses the Supreme Lord. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K???a by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound o?-k?ra. But they do not realize that o?-k?ra is the sound representation of K???a. The jurisdiction of K???a consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K???a consciousness is blessed.

As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very dif?cult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material nature is de?ned herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas con?rm this as follows:m?y?? tu prak?ti? vidy?n m?yina? tu mahe?varam. �Although m?y? [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m?y? is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe?vara, the supreme controller.� (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 4.10) Another meaning of gu?a is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself � he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord K???a, or His bona ?de representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K???a consciousness, can help one gain such release. K???a, being the Lord of the illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature. The words m?m eva are also signi?cant. M?m means unto K???a (Vi??u) only, and not Brahm? or ?iva. Although Brahm? and ?iva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vi??u, it is not possible for such incarnations of rajo-gu?a (passion) and tamo-gu?a (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of m?y?. In other words, both Brahm? and ?iva are also under the in?uence of m?y?. Only Vi??u is the master of m?y?;therefore He alone can give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 3.8) con?rm this in the phrase tam eva viditv?, or �Freedom is possible only by understanding K???a.� Even Lord ?iva af?rms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi??u. Lord ?iva says, mukti-prad?t? sarve??? vi??ur eva na sa??aya?: �There is no doubt that Vi??u is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.�",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 7",
      "purport" : "It is said in Bhagavad-g?t? that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality K???a one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of ?r? K???a, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don�t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method? The G?t? answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like Brahm?, ?iva, Kapila, the Kum?ras, Manu, Vy?sa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahl?da, Bali, and later on Madhv?c?rya, R?m?nuj?c?rya, ?r? Caitanya and many others � who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc. � surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baf?e the knowledge of �planning commissions.� The atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word du?k?tina?, or �miscreants.� K?t? means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist�s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called du?k?t?, which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected. In the G?t? it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baf?ed, as in the case of Hira?yaka?ipu and R?va?a, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These du?k?tinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below. (1) The m??has are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satis?ed by ?lling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yaj�a (sacri?ce). Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such m??has, material gains, which are destructible, are life�s all in all � despite the fact that the m??has enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satis?ed with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the bene?t of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the ?ickering mundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world. (2) Another class of du?k?t?, or miscreant, is called the nar?dhama, or the lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered nar?dhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man�s relation with Him. In the G?t? the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man�s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead ?r? K???a, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classi?ed as a nar?dhama. We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother�s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in dif?culty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the dif?culties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being in?uenced by m?y?, the illusory energy. It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the Manu-sm?ti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of var???rama. However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is nar?dhama. When the whole population becomes nar?dhama, naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the G?t?, a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned br?hma?a, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. ?r? Nity?nanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typicalnar?dhamas, the brothers Jag?i and M?dh?i, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the nar?dhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee. ?r? Caitanya Mah?prabhu, in propagating the bh?gavata-dharma, or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message isBhagavad-g?t?. The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Nar?dhamas, or the lowest of mankind, willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being. (3) The next class of du?k?t? is called m?yay?pah?ta-j�?n??, or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nulli?ed by the in?uence of illusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows � great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc. � but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord. There are a great number of m?yay?pah?ta-j�?n?? at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of theBhagavad-g?t?. In the G?t?, in plain and simple language, it is stated that ?r? K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahm?, the original father of all human beings. In fact, ?r? K???a is said to be not only the father of Brahm? but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Param?tm?; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the m?yay?pah?ta-j�?n?? deride the personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord. All the unauthorized interpretations of the G?t? by the class of m?yay?pah?ta-j�?n??, outside the purview of theparampar? system, are so many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of ?r? K???a, nor do they teach others to follow this principle. (4) The last class of du?k?t? is called ?sura? bh?vam ??rit??, or those of demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the G?t?. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of ?r? K???a. ?r? Y?mun?c?rya ?labandaru of South India said, �O my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Your uncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality�s being con?rmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities.� Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the deluded speculators and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.",

      "purport" : "Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures, and they are called su-k?tina?, or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men � those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees, because they have some aspiration to ful?ll in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material pro?t. The Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu (1.1.11) de?nes pure devotion thus: any?bhil??it?-??nya? j�?na-karm?dy-an?v?tam ?nuk?lyena k????nu- ??lana? bhaktir uttam? �One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K???a favorably and without desire for material pro?t or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.� When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely puri?ed by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very dif?cult because their lives are sel?sh, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees. Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every ?eld of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Param?tm? and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a puri?ed stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.",

By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his material body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Param?tm?.

      "purport" : "The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one�s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord ?r? K???a�s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes, and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted re?ection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K???a. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to V?sudeva, or ?r? K???a. Such a universal vision of V?sudeva precipitates one�s full surrender to the Supreme Lord ?r? K???a as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.

K???a, is the prime entity in everything. In this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the Supreme Lord.

Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord.

      "purport" : "God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone�s heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can ful?ll their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence � whatever one likes � but His ultimate instruction we ?nd in the Bhagavad-g?t?: one should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy. Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvat?; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Um?, the wife of Lord ?iva. In this way there are recommendations in the ??stras (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an af?nity, but because He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of all living entities, K???a gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature it is stated: �The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to ful?ll the desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the supreme will. They are not independent.�",

      "purport" : "The demigods cannot award benedictions to their devotees without the permission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some bene?t. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material bene?t, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to ful?ll his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity and the Lord Himself does not ful?ll the desire. In the Caitanya-carit?m?ta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional service to the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform, because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual. For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material bene?ts desired by less intelligent living entities, who therefore prefer to worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.",

      "purport" : "Some commentators on the Bhagavad-g?t? say that one who worships a demigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god�s planet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead. Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don�t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn�t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord. Not only are the demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam it is stated that the br?hma?as are the head of the Supreme Lord, the k?atriyas are His arms, thevai?yas are His waist, the ??dras are His legs, and all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and he himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches. The results achieved by the demigods� benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in K???a consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.",

      "purport" : "Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord K???a in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y?mun?c?rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession of R?m?nuj?c?rya, has written a very appropriate verse in this connection. He says, tv?? ??la-r?pa-caritai? parama-prak???ai? sattvena s?ttvikatay? prabalai? ca ??strai? prakhy?ta-daiva-param?rtha-vid?? matai? ca naiv?sura-prak?taya? prabhavanti boddhum �My dear Lord, devotees like Vy?sadeva and N?rada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Ved?nta and the Upani?ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.� (Stotra-ratna 12) In the Brahma-sa?hit? it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of theVed?nta literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved?nta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K???a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God�s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as abuddhaya?, which means those who do not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul � but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor ?a?kar?c?rya, who has speci?cally stated that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K???a to be only the son of Devak? and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in theBhagavad-g?t? (9.11). Avaj?nanti m?? m??h? m?nu??? tanum ??ritam: �Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.� The fact is that no one can understand K???a without rendering devotional service and without developing K???a consciousness. The Bh?gavatam (10.14.29) con?rms this: ath?pi te deva pad?mbuja-dvaya- pras?da-le??nug?h?ta eva hi j?n?ti tattva? bhagavan-mahimno na c?nya eko �pi cira? vicinvan �My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.� One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K???a consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah?-mantra � Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare � then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K???a has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything are m?y?. These impersonalists are known as M?y?v?d?s. They do not know the ultimate truth. The twentieth verse clearly states, k?mais tais tair h?ta-j�?n?? prapadyante �nya-devat??: �Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods.� It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse, dev?n deva-yajo y?nti mad-bhakt? y?nti m?m api: the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K???a go to the K???aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the G?t? does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs. Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the Bhagavad-g?t? we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K???a is sac-cid-?nanda,eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedic literature con?rms that the Supreme Absolute Truth is knowledge and blissful pleasure, vij�?nam ?nandam brahma (B?had-?ra?yaka Upani?ad 3.9.28), and that He is the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities, ananta-kaly?na-gu??tmako �sau (Vi??u Pur??a 6.5.84). And in the G?t? the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from theBhagavad-g?t?. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the G?t? are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K???a, has both form and personality.",

But actually He was not manifest to everyone. When K???a was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when ?i?up?la spoke against K???a�s being elected president of the assembly, Bh??ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the P???avas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in the Bhagavad-g?t?K???a says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His internal potency. In the prayers of Kunt? in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (1.8.19) it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-m?y? and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. This yoga-m?y? curtain is also con?rmed in the ??opani?ad(Mantra 15), in which the devotee prays: hira?mayena p?tre?a satyasy?pihita? mukham tat tva? p??ann ap?v??u satya-dharm?ya d???aye �O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle.

May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.� The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of thebrahma-jyotir, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account. Also in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahm?: �O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them.� The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K???a, is not only unborn but also avyaya, inexhaustible.

      "purport" : "Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If K???a, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were m?y?, material, as the impersonalists consider Him to be, then like the living entity He would change His body and forget everything about His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future. Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord K???a clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K???a remembers instructing Vivasv?n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K???a knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being�s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot realize ?r? K???a as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of ?r? K???a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and m?y? is like a cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly, m?y? cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord K???a is.

      "purport" : "Persons acting in K???a consciousness are never deviated from the path of entirely understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of K???a consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and at the time of death such a K???a conscious person can never forget K???a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V?nd?vana. This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K???a conscious person. The beginning of K???a consciousness is association of persons who are K???a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K???a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K???a and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K???a consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K???a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K???a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord. Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Param?tm?, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K???a consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K???a consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord K???a. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by his doing so, all his objectives will be ful?lled. This determined faith is called d??ha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga, or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-g?t? is the substance of that conviction. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute. Chapter Eight: Attaining the Supreme",

Both Indra and Vi??u are worshiped by yaj�aperformances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yaj�a (sacri?ce) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity. Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhus?dana because K???a once killed a demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a K???a conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since K???a is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhus?dana so that K???a might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna�s mind. Now the word pray??a-k?le in this verse is very signi?cant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in K???a consciousness. What should be their position at that ?nal moment? At the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. Thus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the Supreme Lord. Mah?r?ja Kula?ekhara, a great devotee, prays, �My dear Lord, just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet.� The metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in digging into the lotus ?owers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus ?ower. Mah?r?ja Kula?ekhara says to the Lord, �Now my mind is undisturbed, and I am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But if I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, because at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name.

      "purport" : "Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Para-brahman. Brahman refers to the living entity, and Para-brahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual consciousness, K???a consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of material consciousness. In Vedic literature the living entity is called j?v?tm? and Brahman, but he is never called Para-brahman. The living entity (j?v?tm?) takes different positions � sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identi?es himself with matter, and sometimes he identi?es himself with the superior, spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord�s marginal energy. According to his identi?cation with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacri?ces (yaj�a), but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process is called karma. The Ch?ndogya Upani?ad describes the Vedic sacri?cial process. On the sacri?cial altar, ?ve kinds of offerings are made into ?ve kinds of ?re. The ?ve kinds of ?re are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man and woman, and the ?ve kinds of sacri?cial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on the moon, rain, grains and semen. In the process of sacri?ce, the living entity makes speci?c sacri?ces to attain speci?c heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacri?ce is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacri?ce and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K???a conscious person, however, avoids such sacri?ces. He takes directly to K???a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead. Impersonalist commentators on the Bhagavad-g?t? unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of j?va in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the G?t?. But in this verse the Lord also speaks of the living entity as �an eternal fragment of Myself.� The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of j?va is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Para-brahman (the Supreme Lord).",

This physical nature is called adhibh?ta. It is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point. The conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord, which includes all the demigods and their different planets, is called adhidaivata. And present in the body along with the individual soul is the Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K???a. The Supersoul is called the Param?tm? or adhiyaj�a and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the Param?tm? is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul�s activities and is the source of the soul�s various types of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity to act freely and witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clari?ed for the pure K???a conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service to the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivata is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul.

A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of K???a attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true that a person who thinks of something other than K???a attains the same transcendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mah?r?ja Bharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one�s thoughts during the course of one�s life accumulate to in?uence one�s thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one�s next life. If in one�s present life one lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of K???a, it is possible for one to remember K???a at the end of one�s life. That will help one be transferred to the transcendental nature of K???a. If one is transcendentally absorbed in K???a�s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material.

That is very dif?cult. The process of thinking of K???a, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord is puru?a, a person � we think of the person R?ma and the person K???a. And whether one thinks of R?ma or of K???a, what He is like is described in this verse of Bhagavad-g?t?. The Lord is kavi; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are ?oating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (�inconceivable�) is very signi?cant in this connection. God�s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material world, which is insigni?cant compared to the spiritual world � so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, Bhagavad-g?t? and ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam and follow the principles they set down.

A pure devotee does not practice such yoga, but because he is always engaged in K???a consciousness, at death he can remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His grace. This is explained in verse 14. The particular use of the word yoga-balena is signi?cant in this verse because without practice of yoga � whether?a?-cakra-yoga or bhakti-yoga � one cannot come to this transcendental state of being at the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death; one must have practiced some yoga system, especially the system of bhakti-yoga. Since one�s mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice transcendence throughyoga during one�s life.",

      "purport" : "Lord ?r? K???a has recommended to Arjuna the practice of ?a?-cakra-yoga, in which one places the air of life between the eyebrows. Taking it for granted that Arjuna might not know how to practice ?a?-cakra-yoga, the Lord explains the process in the following verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one without a second, has various manifestations and features. Especially for the impersonalists, the ak?ara, or o?-k?ra � the syllable o? � is identical with Brahman. K???a here explains the impersonal Brahman, into which the renounced order of sages enter. In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate o? and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman�s features. This practice is very essential for the student�s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmac?r? (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one�s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmac?r? principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very dif?cult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in this age no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy names of Lord K???a: Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare.",

      "purport" : "This verse especially describes the ?nal destination attained by the unalloyed devotees who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in bhakti-yoga. Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of devotees � the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been described: karma-yoga, j�?na-yoga and ha?ha-yoga. The principles of these yoga systems have some bhakti added, but this verse particularly mentions pure bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of j�?na, karma or ha?ha. As indicated by the word ananya-cet??, in pure bhakti-yoga the devotee desires nothing but K???a. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the brahma-jyotir or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In theCaitanya-carit?m?ta the pure devotee is called ni?k?ma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a j�?na-yog?, karma-yog? or ha?ha-yog? has his own sel?sh interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is un?inchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain. A pure devotee always engages in devotional service to K???a in one of His various personal features. K???a has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as R?ma and N?si?ha, and a devotee can choose to ?x his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare K???a. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those who always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As stated in the Vedas (Ka?ha Upani?ad 1.2.23), yam evai?a v??ute tena labhyas/ tasyai?a ?tm? viv??ute tanu? sv?m: one who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in Bhagavad-g?t? (10.10), dad?mi buddhi-yoga? tam: the Lord gives such a devotee suf?cient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom. The special quali?cation of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of K???a without deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V?nd?vana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V?nd?vana by his devotional service. It was ?r? Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, �Wherever You are, O Lord � there is V?nd?vana.� As indicated by the words satatam and nitya?a?, which mean �always,� �regularly,� or �every day,� a pure devotee constantly remembers K???a and meditates upon Him. These are quali?cations of the pure devotee, for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the G?t? recommends above all others. Generally, thebhakti-yog?s are engaged in ?ve different ways: (1) ??nta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2)d?sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) sakhya-bhakta, engaged as friend; (4) v?tsalya-bhakta,engaged as parent; and (5) m?dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K???a conscious process of chanting the mah?-mantra � Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare.",

The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tret?-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dv?para-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And ?nally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki avat?ra, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahm?, and the same number comprise one night. Brahm? lives one hundred of such �years� and then dies. These �hundred years� by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 billion earth years.

      "purport" : "It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination, from which there is no return, is the abode of K???a, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-sa?hit? describes this supreme abode as ?nanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss � nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere � both in the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasy?nta?-sth?ni means that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies. To enter K???a�s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaiku??ha planets is possible only by bhakti, devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the word bhakty?. No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The Vedas (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad 1.21) also describe the supreme abode and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko va?? sarva-ga? k???a?. In that abode there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is K???a. He is the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The Vedas compare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits, ?owers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside over the Vaiku??ha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of names � Puru?ottama, Trivikrama, Ke?ava, M?dhava, Aniruddha, H???ke?a, Sa?kar?a?a, Pradyumna, ?r?dhara, V?sudeva, D?modara, Jan?rdana, N?r?ya?a, V?mana, Padman?bha, etc. The Brahma-sa?hit? (5.37) also con?rms that although the Lord is always in the supreme abode, Goloka V?nd?vana, He is all-pervading, so that everything is going on nicely (goloka eva nivasaty akhil?tma-bh?ta?). As stated in the Vedas (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 6.8), par?sya ?aktir vividhaiva ?r?yate/ sv?bh?vik? j�?na-bala-kriy? ca: His energies are so expansive that they systematically conduct everything in the cosmic manifestation without a ?aw, although the Supreme Lord is far, far away.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 8",
      "purport" : "This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth chapters, which particularly deal with K???a consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac?r? has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master�s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya. After the student studies the Vedas under the master for some time � at least from age ?ve to twenty � he becomes a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmac?r? is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many sacri?ces so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give charity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-g?t?. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order ofv?naprastha, he undergoes severe penances � living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya, householder life, v?naprastha and ?nally sanny?sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahma-jyotir or in the Vaiku??ha planets or K???aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures. The beauty of K???a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life. The words ida? viditv? indicate that one should understand the instructions given by ?r? K???a in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g?t?. One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees. Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence ofBhagavad-g?t?. The ?rst six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which are especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g?t? � especially these middle six chapters � in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glori?ed beyond all penances, sacri?ces, charities, speculations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by K???a consciousness. One who has a little faith in Bhagavad-g?t? should learn Bhagavad-g?t? from a devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that Bhagavad-g?t? can be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of Bhagavad-g?t?. One should therefore learn Bhagavad-g?t? from a devotee of K???a, not from mental speculators. This is a sign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee�s association one actually begins to study and understand Bhagavad-g?t?. By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service, and this service dispels all one�s misgivings about K???a, or God, and K???a�s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes ?xed in one�s study. Then one relishes the study of Bhagavad-g?t? and attains the state of feeling always K???a conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K???a. This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to K???a�s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V?nd?vana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 9",
      "purport" : "As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam: �The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees.� This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge. The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord�s service. The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in K???a consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of K???a in the association of devotees. Discussion of K???a is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord K???a, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more con?dential than any He has already disclosed. The very beginning of Bhagavad-g?t?, the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called con?dential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth chapters are speci?cally related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in K???a consciousness, they are called more con?dential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most con?dential. One who is situated in the most con?dential knowledge of K???a is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we shall ?nd in the Bhagavad-g?t?, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person. Now this ?rst verse has speci?c signi?cance. The words ida? j�?nam (�this knowledge�) refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, K???a consciousness. When one�s heart is thus cleared of material contamination, one can understand this science of K???a. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not suf?cient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who understands that he is not the body. In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapter Nine the glories of the Lord will be delineated. The Sanskrit word anas?yave in this verse is also very signi?cant. Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on Bhagavad-g?t? very inaccurately. Because they are envious of K???a, their commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are bona ?de. No one can explain Bhagavad-g?t? or give perfect knowledge of K???a if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of K???a without knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who understands that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very bene?cial.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 9",
      "purport" : "This chapter of Bhagavad-g?t? is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. Among the principal philosophers in India are Gautama, Ka??da, Kapila, Y?j�avalkya, ????ilya and Vai?v?nara. And ?nally there is Vy?sadeva, the author of the Ved?nta-s?tra. So there is no dearth of knowledge in the ?eld of philosophy or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of theVedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most con?dential because con?dential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all con?dential knowledge culminates in devotional service. Generally, people are not educated in this con?dential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of the body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul. The Bhagavad-g?t?, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable (antavanta ime deh? nityasyokt?? ?ar?ri?a?). That is a con?dential part of knowledge: simply knowing that the spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is ?nished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most con?dential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most con?dential part of all knowledge. This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature. In the Padma Pur??a, man�s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is ?rst a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it ?owers and bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the ?owers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructi?ed and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain. As explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. This statement is con?rmed in the Padma Pur??a: apr?rabdha-phala? p?pa? k??a? b?ja? phalonmukham krame?aiva pral?yeta vi??u-bhakti-rat?tman?m For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructi?ed, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttama means transcendental.Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttama means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature. It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of K???a (Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes puri?ed of all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of K???a consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or quali?cation. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure. In the Ved?nta-s?tra (3.2.26) this is also described in the following words: prak??a? ca karma?y abhy?s?t.�Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened without a doubt.� A practical example of this can be seen in the previous life of N?rada, who in that life happened to be the son of a maidservant. He had no education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, N?rada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. N?rada personally says, ucchi??a-lep?n anumodito dvijai? sak?t sma bhu�je tad-ap?sta-kilbi?a? eva? prav?ttasya vi?uddha-cetasas tad-dharma ev?tma-ruci? praj?yate In this verse from ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (1.5.25) N?rada describes his previous life to his disciple Vy?sadeva. He says that while engaged as a boy servant for those puri?ed devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they gave it N?rada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as pure-hearted as the sages. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service to the Lord by hearing and chanting, and N?rada gradually developed the same taste. N?rada says further, tatr?nv-aha? k???a-kath?? prag?yat?m anugrahe?????ava? mano-har?? t?? ?raddhay? me �nu-pada? vi???vata? priya?ravasy a?ga mam?bhavad ruci? By associating with the sages, N?rada got the taste for hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore, as described in the Ved?nta-s?tra, prak??a? ca karma?y abhy?s?t: if one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called pratyak?a, directly perceived. The word dharmyam means �the path of religion.� N?rada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child N?rada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religion. The highest goal of all religion is devotional service, as stated in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (sa vai pu?s?? paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok?aje). Religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional service. As we have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight (vede?u yaj�e?u tapa?su caiva), generally Vedic knowledge is required for self-realization. But here, although N?rada never went to the school of the spiritual master and was not educated in the Vedic principles, he acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also con?rmed in Vedic literature: ?c?ryav?n puru?o veda. One who is in association with great ?c?ryas, even if he is not educated or has never studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization. The process of devotional service is a very happy one (su-sukham). Why? Devotional service consists of ?rava?a? k?rtana? vi??o?, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized ?c?ryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patra? pu?pa? phala? toyam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a ?ower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting thetulas? leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kum?ra became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him. It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the M?y?v?d? philosophers claim. Although they sometimes take to so-called devotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they will �become one with God.� Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord. As will be seen in Bhagavad-g?t?, actual devotional service begins after liberation. After one is liberated, when one is situated in the Brahman position (brahma-bh?ta), one�s devotional service begins (sama? sarve?u bh?te?u mad-bhakti? labhate par?m). No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, j�?na-yoga, a????ga-yoga or any other yoga independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little progress toward bhakti-yoga, but without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam it is also con?rmed that when one becomes puri?ed by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam or Bhagavad-g?t? from realized souls, then he can understand the science of K???a, or the science of God. Eva? prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata?. When one�s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K???a consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all con?dential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without dif?culty. Therefore one should adopt it.",

      "purport" : "The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees. Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot stay ?xed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important factor for progress in K???a consciousness. In the Caitanya-carit?m?ta it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord, ?r? K???a, one can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. As stated in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (4.31.14), yath? taror m?la-ni?ecanena t?pyanti tat-skandha-bhujopa??kh?? pr??opah?r?c ca yathendriy???? tathaiva sarv?rha?am acyutejy? �By giving water to the root of a tree one satis?es its branches, twigs and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satis?es all the senses of the body. Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord one automatically satis?es all the demigods and all other living entities.� Therefore, after readingBhagavad-g?t? one should promptly come to the conclusion of Bhagavad-g?t?: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, K???a, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith. Now, the development of that faith is the process of K???a consciousness. There are three divisions of K???a conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. Even if they are of?cially engaged in devotional service, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven�t complete conviction and faith, it is very dif?cult for them to continue in K???a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to K???a consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K???a consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of ?rm faith is called a ?rst-class person in K???a consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have ?rm faith that k???a-bhakti, or service to K???a, is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K???a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class he does not fall down, and for the ?rst-class person in K???a consciousness there is no chance of falling down. One in the ?rst class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K???a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K???a is very good, he has not yet gained adequate knowledge of K???a through the scriptures like ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam and Bhagavad-g?t?. Sometimes these third-class persons in K???a consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga and j�?na-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or j�?na-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or ?rst-class persons in K???a consciousness. Faith in K???a is also divided into three stages and described in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam.First-class attachment, second-class attachment and third-class attachment are also explained in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about K???a and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, ?nd the path very dif?cult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope of gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.",

      "purport" : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said, ata? ?r?-k???a-n?m?di na bhaved gr?hyam indriyai? sevonmukhe hi jihv?dau svayam eva sphuraty ada? (Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu 1.2.234) Lord ?r? K???a�s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-sa?hit? (5.38) it is stated,prem?�jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa? sadaiva h?daye?u vilokayanti: one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. This is indicated here by the word avyakta-m?rtin?. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies � the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy. Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such an argument the Lord says, �I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.� For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king�s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king�s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the Bhagavad-g?t?, vi??abhy?ham ida? k?tsnam: He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.",

      "purport" : "The Lord says that everything is resting on Him (mat-sth?ni sarva-bh?t?ni). This should not be misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with K???a�s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are ?oating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, �Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead I am aloof from them.� This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord. In the Nirukti Vedic dictionary it is said, yujyate �nena durgha?e?u k?rye?u: �The Supreme Lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy.� His person is full of different potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to be understood. We may think of doing something, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like. But when K???a wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will, everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet everything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam ai?varam, the mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

The sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive. And in that sky the wind or air is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic world. The movement of the air in?uences the movements of everything. But although the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as the sky is always aloof from the activities of the wind. In the Upani?ads it is stated, yad-bh??? v?ta? pavate: �It is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.� (Taittir?ya Upani?ad 2.8.1) In the B?had-?ra?yaka Upani?ad (3.8.9) it is stated, etasya v? ak?arasya pra??sane g?rgi s?rya-candramasau vidh?tau ti??hata etasya v? ak?arasya pra??sane g?rgi dy?v-?p?thivyau vidh?tau ti??hata?. �By the supreme order, under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun, and the other great planets are moving.� In the Brahma-sa?hit?

      "purport" : "From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K???a to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is con?rmed in the Brahma-sa?hit? (??vara? parama? k???a?); He is the Supreme Lord. There are many ??varas, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we ?nd some of?cial or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the Brahma-sa?hit? it is said that K???a is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the material and spiritual world, but K???a is the supreme controller (??vara? parama? k???a?), and His body is sac-cid-?nanda,nonmaterial. Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here m?nu??m because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna�s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk?etra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha � eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is con?rmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-?nanda-r?p?ya k????ya: �I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.� (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad 1.1) There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam eka? govindam: �You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.� Sac-cid-?nanda-vigraham: �And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.� (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad1.38) Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord K???a�s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g?t? who deride K???a as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of ?r? K???a is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called m??ha, for only foolish persons consider K???a to be an ordinary human being. The foolish consider K???a an ordinary human being because they do not know the con?dential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that K???a�s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that K???a has so many transcendental quali?cations, they deride Him. Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m?y? duratyay?), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to K???a can get out of the in?uence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of K???a is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K???a, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the in?nite and the minute. Actually, although He is controlling the in?nite and the ?nite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam ai?varam, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the in?nite and the ?nite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how K???a, who appears just like a human being, can control the in?nite and the ?nite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in K???a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord. There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord�s appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-g?t? and ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of K???a, then we can understand that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by ?aunaka inquired about the activities of K???a, they said: k?tav?n kila karm??i saha r?me?a ke?ava? ati-marty?ni bhagav?n g??ha? kapa?a-m??u?a? �Lord ?r? K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with Balar?ma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.� (Bh?g. 1.1.20) The Lord�s appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that K???a performed while He was present on this earth. When K???a appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devak?, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. As stated in the Bh?gavatam(10.3.46), babh?va pr?k?ta? ?i?u?: He became just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again it is indicated that the Lord�s appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g?t? also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see K???a�s form of four hands (tenaiva r?pe?a catur-bhujena). After revealing this form, K???a, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (m?nu?a? r?pam). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being. Some of those who deride K???a and who are infected with the M?y?v?d? philosophy quote the following verse from the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (3.29.21) to prove that K???a is just an ordinary man. Aha? sarve?u bh?te?u bh?t?tm?vasthita? sad?: �The Supreme is present in every living entity.� We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai??ava ?c?ryas like J?va Gosv?m? and Vi?van?tha Cakravart? ?h?kura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K???a. J?va Gosv?m?, commenting on this verse, says that K???a, in His plenary expansion as Param?tm?, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arc?-m?rti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Vi?van?tha Cakravart? ?h?kura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because K???a is present in everyone�s heart as Param?tm?, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the Param?tm? dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected. There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will ?ght with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in K???a consciousness knows that although K???a is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as con?rmed in theBrahma-sa?hit?. Although His personal abode is Goloka V?nd?vana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.",

For them, the fruit of devotional service � going back to Godhead � will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. In other words, persons who mock K???a are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g?t?, such demonic miscreants never surrender to K???a. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and K???a are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with K???a will be baf?ed because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the Ved?nta-s?tra and the Upani?ads, is always baf?ed. It is a great offense, therefore, to consider K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of K???a. The B?had-vi??u-sm?ti clearly states: yo vetti bhautika? deha? k???asya param?tmana? sa sarvasm?d bahi?-k?rya? ?rauta-sm?rta-vidh?nata? mukha? tasy?valoky?pi sa-cela? sn?nam ?caret �One who considers the body of K???a to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the ?rutiand the sm?ti.

He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ?r? K???a, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the quali?cation. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv? prak?ti, divine nature. So when one is promoted in that way � by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead � one attains to the stage of great soul, mah?tm?. The mah?tm? does not divert his attention to anything outside K???a, because he knows perfectly well that K???a is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mah?tm?, or great soul, develops through association with other mah?tm?s, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by K???a�s other features, such as the four-armed Mah?-vi??u. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of K???a. They are not attracted to other features of K???a, nor are they concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being.

His symptoms are described here: amah?tm? is always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord K???a, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business. He is always engaged in the glori?cation of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glori?cation is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a mah?tm? is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the brahma-jyotir, is not described asmah?tm? in the Bhagavad-g?t?. He is described in a different way in the next verse. The mah?tm? is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, hearing and chanting about Vi??u, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion: ?rava?a? k?rtana? vi??o? and smara?am,remembering Him. Such a mah?tm? has ?rm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the ?ve transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages all activities � mental, bodily and vocal, everything � in the service of the Supreme Lord, ?r? K???a. That is called full K???a consciousness. In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ek?da??, and on the appearance day of the Lord. All these rules and regulations are offered by the great ?c?ryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The mah?tm?s, great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result. As described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional service easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a sanny?s? or abrahmac?r?; in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually mah?tm?, a great soul.",

Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way.

      "purport" : "For the intelligent person, it is essential to be in K???a consciousness, engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, in order to achieve a permanent, blissful abode for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such a marvelous result is very easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the poor, without any kind of quali?cation. The only quali?cation required in this connection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does not matter what one is or where one is situated. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water or fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will be pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred from K???a consciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such a fool that he does not want to be K???a conscious by this simple method and thus attain the highest perfectional life of eternity, bliss and knowledge? K???a wants only loving service and nothing more. K???a accepts even a little ?ower from His pure devotee. He does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee. He is not in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-suf?cient, and yet He accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To develop K???a consciousness is the highest perfection of life. Bhakti is mentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that bhakti, or devotional service, is the only means to approach K???a. No other condition, such as becoming a br?hma?a, a learned scholar, a very rich man or a great philosopher, can induce K???a to accept some offering. Without the basic principle of bhakti, nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept anything from anyone. Bhakti is never causal. The process is eternal. It is direct action in service to the absolute whole. Here Lord K???a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord and the real object of all sacri?cial offerings, reveals what types of sacri?ces He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be puri?ed and to reach the goal of life � the transcendental loving service of God � then one should ?nd out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K???a will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus meat, ?sh and eggs should not be offered to K???a. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, ?owers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, �I will accept it.� Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, ?sh and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K???a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods. In the Third Chapter, verse 13, ?r? K???a explains that only the remains of sacri?ce are puri?ed and ?t for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord K???a and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create ?ne brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. K???a has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K???a. The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-g?t?. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K???a, the speaker of the Bhagavad-g?t?. But, in actuality, K???a, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K???a is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, K???a has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K???a�s hearing the devotee�s words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K???a as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.",

Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to K???a, then that is called yukta-vair?gya. Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also speci?ed. By this liberation he does not become one with the brahma-jyotir, but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: m?m upai?yasi, �he comes to Me,� back home, back to Godhead. There are ?ve different stages of liberation, and here it is speci?ed that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord. Anyone who has no interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a sanny?s?. Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependent on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the bene?t of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so. It is said, therefore, by Vai??ava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact words are t??ra v?kya, kriy?, mudr? vij�eha n? bujhaya (Caitanya-carit?m?ta, Madhya 23.39).

      "purport" : "One may question here that if K???a is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living entity � in whatever form � is His son, and so He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives speci?c attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in K???a consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in K???a. The very phrase �K???a consciousness� suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, mayi te: �They are in Me.� Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the words ye yath? m?? prapadyante t??s tathaiva bhaj?my aham: �Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.� This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glori?ed, and at the same time the diamond is glori?ed. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is. The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord�s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord�s reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function. Devotional service to the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world, where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.",

      "purport" : "The word su-dur?c?ra? used in this verse is very signi?cant, and we should understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in K???a consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of K???a consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in K???a consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, puri?es him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yog?fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K???a consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once recti?ed. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K???a consciousness. Therefore a person who is situated in K???a consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words s?dhur eva, �he is saintly,� are very emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the word mantavya? is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only quali?cation of a devotee is to be un?inchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service. In the N?si?ha Pur??a the following statement is given: bhagavati ca har?v ananya-cet? bh??a-malino �pi vir?jate manu?ya? na hi ?a?a-kalu?a-cchabi? kad?cit timira-par?bhavat?m upaiti candra? The meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon. Such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable. On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to ?ght the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.",

One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good quali?cations whatsoever. The question remains, then, How can a person engaged in abominable activities � either by accident or by intention � be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good quali?cations, as is stated in the?r?mad-Bh?gavatam. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations.",

In the?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (2.4.18) it is stated that even the lowest, who are called ca???las (dog-eaters), can be puri?ed by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be puri?ed by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are classi?ed in the mode of goodness (br?hma?as), the mode of passion (k?atriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (vai?yas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (??dras, or workers). Those lower than them are called ca???las, and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the association of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the highest perfection of life.

      "purport" : "In this verse it is clearly indicated that K???a consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K???a�s mind and K???a. K???a is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, His mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in theK?rma Pur??a, as it is quoted by Bhaktisiddh?nta Sarasvat? Gosv?m? in his Anubh??ya comments on Caitanya-carit?m?ta (Fifth Chapter, ?di-l?l?, verses 41�48), deha-dehi-vibhedo �ya? ne?vare vidyate kvacit. This means that there is no difference in K???a, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But because the commentators do not know this science of K???a, they hide K???a and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K???a, some men make pro?t out of misleading people. There are some who are demonic; they also think of K???a, but enviously, just like King Ka?sa, K???a�s uncle. He was also thinking of K???a always, but he thought of K???a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K???a would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K???a in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of K???a continuously. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona ?de teacher. K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K???a will help one become a devotee. Understanding K???a otherwise, from the wrong source, will prove fruitless. One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K???a; with conviction in his heart that K???a is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K???a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K???a. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities � everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K???a without deviation. This will help one transfer to K???aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K???a. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society. The Seventh and Eighth chapters of Bhagavad-g?t? have explained pure devotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic yoga and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sancti?ed may be attracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahma-jyotir and localized Param?tm?, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord. There is a beautiful poem about K???a in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K???a. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yog?s. One who always engages in K???a consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of K???a consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K???a.

Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand K???a; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful, uncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the quali?cation necessary to understand K???a. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand K???a by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand K???a by such foolish speculation. Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, �Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.� One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K???a, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-g?t? and ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam. The conception of God as some ruling power or as the impersonal Brahman can be reached by persons who are in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position. Because most men cannot understand K???a in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord�s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K???a. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K???a they can understand K???a.

      "purport" : "As stated in the Seventh Chapter (7.3), manu?y???? sahasre?u ka?cid yatati siddhaye: those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men; they are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization. But out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully understood K???a�s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions. Here the Lord is described by the word aja, meaning �unborn,� but He is distinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as aja. The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment. The conditioned souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior, material energy, but is always in the superior energy. In this verse the words vetti loka-mahe?varam indicate that one should know that Lord K???a is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the universe. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K???a is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K???a is different even from the great demigods like Brahm? and ?iva. And because He is the creator of Brahm?, ?iva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets. ?r? K???a is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated inBhagavad-g?t?. One should not try to understand K???a as a human being. As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions. If K???a is known as the son of Devak?, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam: When He appeared before Devak? and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. Anything done under the direction of K???a is transcendental. It cannot be contaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends on activities in K???a consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam and Bhagavad-g?t?, or from a bona ?de spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sanny?sa. As stated in the ?rst verse of the Sixth Chapter ofBhagavad-g?t?, one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his activities (an??rita? karma-phalam), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sanny?s? and a yog?, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sanny?s?, or a pseudo yog?.",

In modern education there is no knowledge about spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete. Asammoha, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. K?am?, tolerance and forgiveness, should be practiced; one should be tolerant and excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are, for the bene?t of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straightforward way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the bene?t of others. That is the de?nition of truth. Control of the senses means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use. Similarly, one should restrain the mind from unnecessary thoughts; that is called ?ama. One should not spend one�s time pondering over earning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of K???a consciousness. And similarly, that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of K???a consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of K???a consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected. Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-g?t?. Birth and death apply to one�s embodiment in the material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in K???a consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright. Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand K???a and be situated always in K???a consciousness. In that way we will be free from all fear. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (11.2.37) it is stated, bhaya? dvit?y?bhinive?ata? sy?t: fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy. But those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are con?dent that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in K???a consciousness. Abhayam, fearlessness, is possible only for one in K???a consciousness. Ahi?s?, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually bene?cial for human society. Ahi?s? means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence. Samat?, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. That which is favorable for prosecuting K???a consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samat?, equanimity. A person in K???a consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in terms of its usefulness in the prosecution of K???a consciousness. Tu??i, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satis?ed with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and regulations in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of K???a consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles when they are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-g?t? as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge. As far as charity is concerned, one should give ?fty percent of his earnings to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of K???a consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause. Because K???a is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in K???a consciousness. According to the Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to thebr?hma?as. This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the br?hma?as. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A br?hma?a is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman. Brahma j?n?t?ti br?hma?a?: one who knows Brahman is called a br?hma?a. Thus charity is offered to the br?hma?asbecause they are always engaged in higher spiritual service and have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life, the sanny?s?. The sanny?s?s beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life � awakening their K???a consciousness � it is the business of the sanny?s?s to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be K???a conscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by thesanny?s?s; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the br?hma?as, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause. Ya?as, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a great man in K???a consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One who does not have such fame is infamous. All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in K???a consciousness, K???a creates all these qualities, but the person develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord. Of whatever we ?nd, good or bad, the origin is K???a. Nothing can manifest itself in this material world which is not in K???a. That is knowledge; although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything ?ows from K???a.",

If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam andBhagavad-g?t? and similar literatures.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is the original forefather of all forefathers. These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is ?rmly convinced of them, he accepts K???a with great faith and without any doubt, and he engages in devotional service.

      "purport" : "A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can understand that K???a is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes ?rmly ?xed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that K???a is the source of Brahm?, ?iva and all other demigods. In the Atharva Veda (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad 1.24) it is said, yo brahm??a? vidadh?ti p?rva? yo vai ved??? ca g?payati sma k???a?: �It was K???a who in the beginning instructed Brahm? in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.� Then again the N?r?ya?a Upani?ad (1) says, atha puru?o ha vai n?r?ya?o �k?mayata praj?? s?jeyeti: �Then the Supreme Personality N?r?ya?a desired to create living entities.� The Upani?ad continues, n?r?ya??d brahm? j?yate, n?r?ya??d praj?pati? praj?yate, n?r?ya??d indro j?yate, n?r?ya??d a??au vasavo j?yante, n?r?ya??d ek?da?a rudr? j?yante, n?r?ya??d dv?da??dity??: �From N?r?ya?a, Brahm? is born, and from N?r?ya?a the patriarchs are also born. From N?r?ya?a, Indra is born, from N?r?ya?a the eight Vasus are born, from N?r?ya?a the eleven Rudras are born, from N?r?ya?a the twelve ?dityas are born.� This N?r?ya?a is an expansion of K???a. It is said in the same Vedas, brahma?yo devak?-putra?: �The son of Devak?, K???a, is the Supreme Personality.� (N?r?ya?a Upani?ad 4) Then it is said, eko vai n?r?ya?a ?s?n na brahm? ne??no n?po n?gni-somau neme dy?v-?p?thiv? na nak?atr??i na s?rya?: �In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality N?r?ya?a. There was no Brahm?, no ?iva, no water, no ?re, no moon, no heaven and earth, no stars in the sky, no sun.� (Mah? Upani?ad 1.2) In the Mah? Upani?ad it is also said that Lord ?iva was born from the forehead of the Supreme Lord. Thus the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahm? and ?iva, who is to be worshiped. In the Mok?a-dharma section of the Mah?bh?rata, K???a also says, praj?pati? ca rudra? c?py aham eva s?j?mi vai tau hi m?? na vij?n?to mama m?y?-vimohitau �The patriarchs, ?iva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy.� In the Var?ha Pur??a it is also said, n?r?ya?a? paro devas tasm?j j?ta? caturmukha? tasm?d rudro �bhavad deva? sa ca sarva-j�at?? gata? �N?r?ya?a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahm? was born, from whom ?iva was born.� Lord K???a is the source of all generations, and He is called the most ef?cient cause of everything. He says, �Because everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.� There is no supreme controller other than K???a. One who understands K???a in such a way from a bona ?de spiritual master, with references from Vedic literature, engages all his energy in K???a consciousness and becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know K???a properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider K???a to be an ordinary man. A K???a conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-g?t? and proceed in K???a consciousness with determination and ?rmness.",

      "purport" : "Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K???a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse speci?cally. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K???a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees. In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructi?es, just as the seed of a tree fructi?es with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahma-jyotir effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V?nd?vana, the supreme planet of K???a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K???a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and ?owers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the Caitanya-carit?m?ta (Madhya-l?l?, Chapter Nineteen). It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a ?sh cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord. The ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam is also full of such narrations about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the Bh?gavatam itself (12.13.18). ?r?mad-bh?gavata? pur??am amala? yad vai??av?n?? priyam. In this narration there is nothing about material activities, economic development, sense grati?cation or liberation. ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described.

      "purport" : "In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very signi?cant. We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way ofbuddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yoga itself is action in K???a consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K???a consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yoga. In other words, buddhi-yoga is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K???a. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona ?de spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K???a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved. When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is K???a but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K???a, he is acting inj�?na-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks K???a completely in K???a consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life. A person may have a bona ?de spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but if he is still not intelligent enough to make progress, then K???a from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without dif?culty. The quali?cation is that a person always engage himself in K???a consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K???a, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the path of self-realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him.",

      "purport" : "When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prak???nanda Sarasvat?, a very in?uential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes M?y?v?d? philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by K???a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K???a consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only quali?cation is that one carry out devotional service in full K???a consciousness. The M?y?v?d? philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without suf?cient education and even without suf?cient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse. The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K???a, or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K???a, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has K???a within his heart; and with the presence of K???a, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance is at once dissipated. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by K???a. Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one�s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K???a, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal, Vi??u, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the material necessities of life; he need not be anxious, because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g?t?. By studyingBhagavad-g?t?, one can become a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.",

      "purport" : "In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the M?y?v?d? philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-g?t? in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, �You are para? brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.� And previously K???a stated that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This has already been explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that because K???a is Arjuna�s intimate friend Arjuna is ?attering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is con?rmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions af?rm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is con?rmed by Vedic injunction. In the Kena Upani?ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and K???a has already explained that everything is resting on Him. The Mu??aka Upani?ad con?rms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of K???a is smara?am, one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to K???a that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands that K???a is the purest of the pure can become puri?ed from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna�s acceptance of K???a as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also con?rmed by great personalities, of whom N?rada is the chief. K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one�s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna con?rm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Pur??as and histories. In all Vedic literatures K???a is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, �Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.� He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of K???a. If we want to understand Bhagavad-g?t?, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the parampar? system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-g?t?. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that K???a is an ordinary person.",

He received the authority of Bhagavad-g?t?. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampar? system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-g?t? was lost, and therefore K???a reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to G?topani?ad, Bhagavad-g?t? should be understood in the parampar? system. When the parampar? system was lost, Arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it.

Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K???a. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know K???a should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g?t?. Bhagavad-g?t? is the statement of K???a, and since it is the science of K???a, it should be understood from K???a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons. As stated in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (1.2.11): vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva? yaj j�?nam advayam brahmeti param?tmeti bhagav?n iti ?abdyate The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Param?tm? and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized Param?tm? may not understand God�s personality. Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the Supreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-g?t?, which are being spoken by this person, K???a. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K???a as Bhagav?n, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand K???a as Puru?ottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru?ottama. Yet one still may not understand that K???a is the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bh?ta-bh?vana. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bh?te?a, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K???a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Deva-deva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagat-pati.

Common men, including the demons and atheists, cannot know K???a, because He is guarded by His yoga-m?y? energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their bene?t. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because he is a Vai??ava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses K???a speci?cally as yogin because ?r? K???a is the master of theyoga-m?y? energy, by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for K???a cannot always think of K???a; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world. The words ke?u ke?u ca bh?ve?u refer to material nature (the word bh?va means �physical things�).

Now as far as am?tam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning K???a is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, ?ction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about K???a.

In discussing K???a�s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K???a knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies. The word pr?dh?nyata? (�principal�) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And vibh?ti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In the Amara-ko?adictionary it is stated that vibh?ti indicates an exceptional opulence.

Thus this address by K???a to Arjuna is signi?cant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences. K???a ?rst informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the puru?a incarnation, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is ?tm?, the soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation; actually the Mah?-vi??u enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy. He is the soul. When Mah?-vi??u enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop.

      "purport" : "The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K???a�s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahm?, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them. There is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahm? and ?iva represent only part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is asamaurdhva, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the Padma Pur??a it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K???a in the same category with demigods � be they even Brahm? or ?iva � becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K???a�s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord ?r? K???a and can ?x his mind in the worship of K???a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K???a consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K???a are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses 8 through 11. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter. ?r?la Baladeva Vidy?bh??a?a, a great ?c?rya in disciplic succession from K???a, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying, yac-chakti-le??t s?ry?dy? bhavanty aty-ugra-tejasa? yad-a??ena dh?ta? vi?va? sa k???o da?ame �rcyate From Lord K???a�s potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power, and by K???a�s partial expansion the whole world is maintained. Therefore Lord ?r? K???a is worshipable. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute.",

This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K???a as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has such a great friend as K???a, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K???a as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish K???a�s divinity for all, he is requesting K???a in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K???a one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K???a is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K???a has several times said: K???a is speaking to him just for his bene?t. So Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by K???a�s grace.

Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges K???a�s inestimable position. Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited in?nite. If the in?nite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the in?nite by the grace of the in?nite. The word yoge?vara is also very signi?cant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K???a. He does not give K???a orders.

To see the universal form of K???a, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K???a is not very important; that will be clear in subsequent verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form. Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K???a are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K???a, the friends of K???a and the parents of K???a never want K???a to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K???a is the Supreme Lord. In the?r?mad-Bh?gavatam it is stated that the boys who play with K???a are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with K???a. Such boys do not know that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend.

Arjuna must con?rm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar? system. Those who are actually interested in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K???a not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.

He is praising the universal form. Thus Arjuna�s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see K???a as the reservoir of all relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in K???a. It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Here Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord.

Except for a few P???avas, everyone who was present on that battle?eld would be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in favor of the ?ght, and he thought it was better not to ?ght; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not ?ght, every one of them would be destroyed, for that was His plan. If Arjuna stopped ?ghting, they would die in another way. Death could not be checked, even if he did not ?ght. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord.

But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K???a out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K???a to show His N?r?ya?a form, because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku??ha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as N?r?ya?a. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K???a is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku??ha planets. Of course in each Vaiku??ha planet the form of N?r?ya?a is four-handed, but the four hands hold different arrangements of symbols � the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc.

      "purport" : "The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi??u are demigods (vi??u-bhakta? sm?to daiva?). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi??u, or who recognize only the impersonal part of K???a as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K???a and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna. The Bhagavad-g?t? gives the description of the universal form. Although this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have some idea of the vi?va-r?pa after this incident. Those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K???a. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested in seeing the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K???a as Vi??u, and he was actually afraid of the universal form. In this verse there are some signi?cant words, just like veda-yaj�?dhyayanai?, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacri?cial regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, such as the four Vedas (?g, Yajur, S?ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur??as, the Upani?ads and the Ved?nta-s?tra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are s?tras � Kalpa-s?tras and M?m??s?-s?tras � for studying the method of sacri?ce. D?nai? refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord � the br?hma?as and the Vai??avas. Similarly, �pious activities� refers to the agni-hotra and the prescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains is called tapasya. So one can perform all these � can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc. � but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g?t? we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord. There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-g?t?, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g?t? is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables one to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K???a one cannot see the universal form of God. So one ?rst of all has to become a pure devotee of K???a; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K???a cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.",

      "purport" : "In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K???a concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many pious activities, sacri?ces, etc. Now here the word su-durdar?am is used, indicating that K???a�s two-handed form is still more con?dential. One may be able to see the universal form of K???a by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of K???a with two hands is still more dif?cult to see, even for demigods like Brahm? and Lord ?iva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidence in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devak?, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K???a, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was not at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to Him but to the impersonal �something� within Him, but these are all nonsensical postures. K???a in His two-armed form is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm? and ?iva. In Bhagavad-g?t? (9.11) it is also con?rmed, avaj?nanti m?? m??h? m?nu??? tanum ??ritam: He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K???a�s body, as con?rmed by Brahma-sa?hit? and con?rmed by K???a Himself in Bhagavad-g?t?, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K???a by reading Bhagavad-g?t? or similar Vedic scriptures, K???a is a problem. For one using a material process, K???a is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He was so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K???a and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K???a which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-g?t?, Chapter Four: to hear about K???a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K???a from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K???a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K???a is covered by Hisyoga-m?y? potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is con?rmed in the Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K???a consciousness and by devotional service to K???a, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K???a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is dif?cult even for the demigods to understand K???a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K???a in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K???a is very, very dif?cult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more dif?cult to understand His personal form as ?y?masundara.",

      "purport" : "K???a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g?t? by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K???a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very dif?cult to understand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K???a, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on Janm???am?, the day on which K???a appeared, and on the two days of Ek?da?? (the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K???a who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K???a philosophy, or K???a consciousness, throughout the world. K???a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R?pa Gosv?m? as the most muni?cent man of charity because love of K???a, which is very dif?cult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing K???a consciousness, that charity, given to spread K???a consciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi??u or K???a), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is con?rmed in the Vedic literature (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 6.23): yasya deve par? bhaktir yath? deve tath? gurau tasyaite kathit? hy arth?? prak??ante mah?tmana? One who has un?inching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master, in whom he has similar un?inching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand K???a by mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona ?de spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K???a. The word tu is speci?cally used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K???a. The personal forms of K???a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described as su-durdar?am, very dif?cult to see. They are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form of N?r?ya?a and the two-handed form of K???a are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The words tvad anyena na d???a-p?rvam (verse 47) state that before Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K???a at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form. The word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of K???a. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries on Bhagavad-g?t?. K???a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N?r?ya?a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K???a. He is the origin of all emanations. K???a is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K???a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K???a (which is known as Mah?-vi??u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the Brahma-sa?hit? (5.48), yasyaika-ni?vasita-k?lam ath?valambya j?vanti loma-vila-j? jagad-a??a-n?th?? vi??ur mah?n sa iha yasya kal?-vi?e?o govindam ?di-puru?a? tam aha? bhaj?mi �The Mah?-vi??u, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from whom they come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary expansion of K???a. Therefore I worship Govinda, K???a, the cause of all causes.� Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K???a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi??u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as con?rmed in Bhagavad-g?t?. In the Vedic literature (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad 1.1) the following statement appears: sac-cid-?nanda-r?p?ya k????y?kli??a-k?ri?e namo ved?nta-vedy?ya gurave buddhi-s?k?i?e �I offer my respectful obeisances unto K???a, who has a transcendental form of bliss, eternity and knowledge. I offer my respect to Him, because understanding Him means understanding the Vedas, and He is therefore the supreme spiritual master.� Then it is said, k???o vai parama? daivatam: �K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.� (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad 1.3) Eko va?? sarva-ga? k???a ??ya?: �That one K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is worshipable.� Eko �pi san bahudh? yo �vabh?ti: �K???a is one, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.� (Gop?la-t?pan? Upani?ad 1.21) The Brahma-sa?hit? (5.1) says, ??vara? parama? k???a? sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha? an?dir ?dir govinda? sarva-k?ra?a-k?ra?am �The Supreme Personality of Godhead is K???a, who has a body of eternity, knowledge and bliss. He has no beginning, for He is the beginning of everything. He is the cause of all causes.� Elsewhere it is said, yatr?vat?r?a? k????khya? para? brahma nar?k?ti: �The Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is K???a, and He sometimes descends on this earth.� Similarly, in the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam we ?nd a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in this list the name of K???a also appears. But then it is said that this K???a is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (ete c???a-kal?? pu?sa? k???as tu bhagav?n svayam). Similarly, in Bhagavad-g?t? the Lord says, matta? paratara? n?nyat: �There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K???a.� He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g?t?, aham ?dir hi dev?n?m: �I am the origin of all the demigods.� And after understanding Bhagavad-g?t? from K???a, Arjuna also con?rms this in the following words: para? brahma para? dh?ma pavitra? parama? bhav?n, �I now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.� Therefore the universal form which K???a showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K???a form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God�s original form. The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K???a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K???a in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of K???a�s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of K???a is the most dear.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 11",
      "purport" : "Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K???aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K???a, must take this formula, as stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g?t?. The Bhagavad-g?t? is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g?t? is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K???a conscious activities. As stated in theBhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu (1.2.255), an?saktasya vi?ay?n yath?rham upayu�jata? nirbandha? k???a-sambandhe yukta? vair?gyam ucyate No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K???a. This is called k???a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K???a consciousness, one has to do business for K???a. If K???a is the proprietor of the business, then K???a should enjoy the pro?t of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K???a, he can do it. This is work for K???a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense grati?cation, he can construct a nice temple for K???a, and he can install the Deity of K???a and arrange for the Deity�s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all k???a-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K???a, and one should accept aspras?dam the remnants of offerings to K???a. If one constructs a very big building for K???a and installs the Deity of K???a, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is K???a. That is called K???a consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K???a, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K???a; that is also k???a-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land � in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land � can utilize that for K???a by growing ?owers to offer Him. One can sow tulas? plants, because tulas? leaves are very important and K???a has recommended this in Bhagavad-g?t?. Patra? pu?pa? phala? toyam. K???a desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a ?ower, or fruit, or a little water � and by such an offering He is satis?ed. This leaf especially refers to the tulas?. So one can sow tulas? and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K???a. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K???a. The word mat-parama? refers to one who considers the association of K???a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satis?ed with merging into the glowing brahma-jyotir effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K???aloka, Goloka V?nd?vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta?, he fully engages in devotional service, speci?cally in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect. The term sa?ga-varjita? is very signi?cant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K???a. Not only are the atheistic persons against K???a, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-ras?m?ta-sindhu (1.1.11) as follows: any?bhil??it?-??nya? j�?na-karm?dy-an?v?tam ?nuk?lyena k????nu- ??lana? bhaktir uttam? In this verse ?r?la R?pa Gosv?m? clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K???a, that is called pure devotional service. ?nuk?lyasya sa?kalpa? pr?tik?lyasya varjanam (Hari-bhakti-vil?sa 11.676). One should think of K???a and act for K???a favorably, not unfavorably. Ka?sa was an enemy of K???a�s. From the very beginning of K???a�s birth, Ka?sa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K???a. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K???a conscious in every respect, but that K???a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K???a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K???a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K???a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V?nd?vana. His only objective is to serve K???a wherever he may be. A devotee of K???a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy (nirvaira?). How is this? A devotee situated in K???a consciousness knows that only devotional service to K???a can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K???a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was cruci?ed by the nondevotees, but he sacri?ced his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be super?cial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as ?h?kura Harid?sa and Prahl?da Mah?r?ja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K???a consciousness, and it is dif?cult. A K???a conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K???a. Therefore, the highest bene?t one can render to human society is relieving one�s neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K???a is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body. In summary, the universal form of K???a, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi??u, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K???a. Thus K???a is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K???a is a manifestation of the original vi?va-r?pa, or Vi??u. K???a is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi??us, but for a devotee no form of K???a is important but the original form, two-handed ?y?masundara. In the Brahma-sa?hit? it is stated that those who are attached to the ?y?masundara form of K???a in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K???a is essential and supreme. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of the Universal Form.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 12",
      "purport" : "K???a has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yog?s. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist also engages himself, not directly in the service of K???a but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested. We ?nd in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service. Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K???a indicates in this chapter thatbhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g?t?, the Supreme Lord explained that a living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the Absolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. Then again in the Eighth Chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of K???a at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of K???a. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all yog?s, one who always thinks of K???a within himself is considered the most perfect. So in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of K???a, for that is the highest spiritual realization. Nevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of K???a. They are so ?rmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries to Bhagavad-g?t? they want to distract other people from K???a and transfer all devotion to the impersonal brahma-jyotir. They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest. And so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K???a. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, �What is the use of such a waste of time?� Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K???a is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K???a. This important question asked of K???a by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.",

      "purport" : "The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called j�?na-yog?s, and persons who are in full K???a consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yog?s. Now, here the difference between j�?na-yoga and bhakti-yoga is de?nitely expressed. The process of j�?na-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very dif?cult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yog?accepts the Deity of K???a as worshipable because there is some bodily conception ?xed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be sagu?a or nirgu?a � of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is sagu?a worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord. A crude example may be given here. We may ?nd some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without dif?culty. But any old box, or an imitation which we may ?nd somewhere but which is not authorized by the post of?ce, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arc?-vigraha. This arc?-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arc?-vigraha He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life. So for a devotee there is no dif?culty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is dif?cult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani?ads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K???a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona ?de spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble or dif?culty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam. It is stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called bhakti), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result. A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of j�?na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in dif?culty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual, blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K???a consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus the process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age.

      "purport" : "It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord � and if he does not, then he will render service tom?y?. As stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should ?x his mind fully on K???a in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K???a. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for K???a. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life�s mission is to please K???a, and he can sacri?ce everything for K???a�s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk?etra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord herein promises that without delay He will deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him. The devotee does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky. In the Var?ha Pur??a this verse appears: nay?mi parama? sth?nam arcir-?di-gati? vin? garu?a-skandham ?ropya yatheccham aniv?rita? The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice a????ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garu?a, and at once delivers the devotee from material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of K???a consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the N?r?ya??ya this is con?rmed as follows: y? vai s?dhana-sampatti? puru??rtha-catu??aye tay? vin? tad ?pnoti naro n?r?ya???raya? The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the bene?ts derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacri?ces, charities, etc. That is the speci?c benediction of devotional service. Simply by chanting the holy name of K???a � Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare � a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion. The conclusion of Bhagavad-g?t? is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter: sarva-dharm?n parityajya m?m eka? ?ara?a? vraja aha? tv?? sarva-p?pebhyo mok?ayi?y?mi m? ?uca? One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in K???a consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life, because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead, K???a. That is the highest perfection of life.",

      "purport" : "In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The ?rst applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K???a. Bhakti-yoga is the puri?cation of the senses. At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense grati?cation. But by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become puri?ed, and in the puri?ed state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don�t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses. This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone�s heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material association. Now the heart has to be puri?ed of the material association, and that dormant, natural love for K???a has to be revived. That is the whole process. To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare K???a, then collect ?owers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take pras?dam,and so on. There are various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hearBhagavad-g?t? and ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God.",

How to do this work has already been explained in the ?fty-?fth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of K???a consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of K???a consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of K???a. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense grati?cation. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K???a, and that is spiritual activity. If one has suf?cient money, he can help in building an of?ce or temple for propagating K???a consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various ?elds of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacri?ce the results of his activities, the same person can still sacri?ce some percentage to propagate K???a consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of K???a consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.",

      "purport" : "It may be that one is unable even to sympathize with the activities of K???a consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of K???a consciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many other dif?culties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacri?ce the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacri?ces and special functions for the full-moon day, and there is special work in which the result of one�s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K???a consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one�s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that puri?ed stage of mind one becomes able to understand K???a consciousness. Of course, K???a consciousness is not dependent on any other experience, because K???a consciousness itself can purify one�s mind, but if there are impediments to accepting K???a consciousness, one may try to give up the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacri?ce for one�s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g?t? (18.46) we ?nd it is stated,yata? prav?ttir bh?t?n?m: if one decides to sacri?ce for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause is K???a, he will come gradually to understand that K???a is the supreme cause by the sacri?cial method.",

      "purport" : "As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulative principles and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K???a consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge, because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. In the cultivation of knowledge there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the br?hma?as, k?atriyas, vai?yas and??dras, which we shall ?nd in the last chapter of Bhagavad-g?t?. But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in K???a consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one�s activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take either the step-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-g?t? is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a.",

      "purport" : "Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the transcendental quali?cations of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy�s enemy; he thinks, �This person is acting as my enemy due to my own past misdeeds. So it is better to suffer than to protest.� In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (10.14.8) it is stated: tat te �nukamp?? su-sam?k?am??o bhu�j?na ev?tma-k?ta? vip?kam. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into dif?culty, he thinks that it is the Lord�s mercy upon him. He thinks, �Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.� Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the pains and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equipoised in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satis?ed with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great dif?culty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is ?xed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled he is determined. He is not swayed by false arguments, because no one can lead him from the ?xed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that K???a is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All these quali?cations enable him to ?x his mind and intelligence entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtedly very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full K???a consciousness.",

One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak for the sake of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satis?ed. Nor does he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is called ?xed because he is ?xed in his determination and knowledge.

      "purport" : "In this chapter, from verse 2 through the end � from mayy ?ve?ya mano ye m?m (�?xing the mind on Me�) throughye tu dharm?m?tam idam (�this religion of eternal engagement�) � the Supreme Lord has explained the processes of transcendental service for approaching Him. Such processes are very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question of who is better � one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead � was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona ?de spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be bene?cial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K???a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g?t?, is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of Devotional Service.",

      "purport" : "Arjuna was inquisitive about prak?ti (nature), puru?a (the enjoyer), k?etra (the ?eld), k?etra-j�a (its knower), and knowledge and the object of knowledge. When he inquired about all these, K???a said that this body is called the ?eld and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the ?eld. This body is the ?eld of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord it over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a ?eld of activity. That ?eld of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense grati?cation, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense grati?cation, he is offered a body, or ?eld of activity. Therefore the body is called k?etra, or the ?eld of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person, who should not identify himself with the body, is called k?etra-j�a, the knower of the ?eld. It is not very dif?cult to understand the difference between the ?eld and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the ?eld of activities and the actual ?eld of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning � dehino �smin � that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is distinctly k?etra-j�a. Sometimes we think, �I am happy,� �I am a man,� �I am a woman,� �I am a dog,� �I am a cat.� These are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different from the body. Although we may use many articles � our clothes, etc. � we know that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body. I or you or anyone else who owns the body is called k?etra-j�a, the knower of the ?eld of activities, and the body is called k?etra, the ?eld of activities itself. In the ?rst six chapters of Bhagavad-g?t? the knower of the body (the living entity) and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are described. In the middle six chapters of the Bhagavad-g?t? the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are de?nitely de?ned in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different capacities � as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material nature and how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from the material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained.",

      "purport" : "While discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall ?nd three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every ?eld of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, K???a says, �I am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Param?tm?, or Supersoul.� One who studies the subject matter of the ?eld of activity and the knower of the ?eld very minutely, in terms of thisBhagavad-g?t?, can attain to knowledge. The Lord says, �I am the knower of the ?eld of activities in every individual body.� The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies. The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H???ke?a, which means �the controller of the senses.� He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord says, �I am also the knower.� This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows: k?etr??i hi ?ar?r??i b?ja? c?pi ?ubh??ubhe t?ni vetti sa yog?tm? tata? k?etra-j�a ucyate This body is called the k?etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all ?elds. The distinction between the ?eld of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as j�?na. That is the opinion of K???a. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the ?eld of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak?ti (nature), puru?a (the enjoyer of nature) and ??vara (the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the ?eld of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language (in the?vet??vatara Upani?ad 1.12), bhokt? bhogya? prerit?ra? ca matv?/ sarva? prokta? tri-vidha? brahmam etat.There are three Brahman conceptions: prak?ti is Brahman as the ?eld of activities, and the j?va (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller. In this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the ?eld to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly, �I am also the knower of the ?eld of activity.� One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The wordca is signi?cant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of ?r?la Baladeva Vidy?bh??a?a. K???a is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul. And K???a explicitly says here that real knowledge is to know that the Supersoul is the controller of both the ?eld of activities and the ?nite enjoyer.",

      "purport" : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K???a is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Ved?nta, which is accepted as authority. First He says, �This is according to different sages.� As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy?sadeva (the author of the Ved?nta-s?tra) is a great sage, and in the Ved?nta-s?tra duality is perfectly explained. And Vy?sadeva�s father, Par??ara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity, aham tva? ca tath?nye.� �we � you, I and the various other living entities � are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an in?nite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.� Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka?ha Upani?ad. There are many great sages who have explained this, and Par??ara is considered principal among them. The word chandobhi? refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittir?ya Upani?ad, for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda, describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated before, k?etra is the ?eld of activities, and there are two kinds of k?etra-j�a: the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in the Taittir?ya Upani?ad (2.5), brahma puccha? prati??h?. There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord�s energy known as anna-maya, dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, in pr??a-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In j�?na-maya, realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called vij�?na-maya, in which the living entity�s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is ?nanda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are ?ve stages of Brahman realization, which are called brahma puccham. Out of these, the ?rst three � anna-maya, pr??a-maya and j�?na-maya � involve the ?elds of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these ?elds of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called ?nanda-maya. The Ved?nta-s?tra also describes the Supreme by saying, ?nanda-mayo �bhy?s?t: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij�?na-maya, pr??a-maya, j�?na-maya and anna-maya. In the ?eld of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the ?nanda-maya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the ?nanda-maya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the ?eld, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the ?eld of activities. One has to search for this truth in the Ved?nta-s?tra, or Brahma-s?tra. It is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-s?tra are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect. Some of the s?tras, or aphorisms, are na viyad a?rute? (2.3.2), n?tm? ?rute? (2.3.18), and par?t tu tac-chrute?(2.3.40). The ?rst aphorism indicates the ?eld of activities, the second indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the summum bonum among all the manifestations of various entities.",

First there are earth, water, ?re, air and ether. These are the ?ve great elements (mah?-bh?ta). Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature. Then there are ?ve senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Then ?ve working senses: voice, legs, hands, anus and genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then there are the ?ve objects of the senses: smell, taste, form, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the ?eld of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the ?eld of activity. Then there are desire, hatred, happiness and distress, which are interactions, representations of the ?ve great elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness, and convictions are the manifestation of the subtle body � mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included within the ?eld of activities. The ?ve great elements are a gross representation of the false ego, which in turn represents the primal stage of false ego technically called the materialistic conception, or t?masa-buddhi, intelligence in ignorance. This, further, represents the unmanifested stage of the three modes of material nature. The unmanifested modes of material nature are called pradh?na. One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-g?t?, a summary only is given. The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it produces by-products, then it begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.

Mayi c?nanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhic?ri??: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But if one takes to devotional service in full K???a consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. As stated in ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (5.18.12), yasy?sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki�can? sarvair gu?ais tatra sam?sate sur??.All the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essential. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona ?de spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, ?r? K???a, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense. As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows. Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge � who knows that he is not this body � anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items. Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement. That is nonviolence. Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahl?da, who, only ?ve years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahl?da tolerated him. So there may be many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination. Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona ?de spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a bona ?de spiritual master is a representative of K???a, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple�s following the regulative principles. Or, the regulative principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation. Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of K???a always and chant Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind. Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress. And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense grati?cation. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be grati?ed to keep the body ?t so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K???a and chanting Hare K???a. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of K???a. That will control the eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about K???a and the nose in smelling the ?owers offered to K???a. This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-g?t? is simply expounding the science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-g?t? try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-g?t? than devotional service. False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False ego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (B?had-?ra?yaka Upani?ad 1.4.10) it is said, aha? brahm?smi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This �I am,� the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of �I am� is ego, but when the sense of �I am� is applied to this false body it is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false identi?cation with the body. One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam the world of the unborn, the child�s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life. As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection. But when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is K???a consciousness. If one is in full K???a consciousness, he can make his home very happy, because this process of K???a consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K???a, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-g?t? and?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things will make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop K???a consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned. One must sacri?ce everything to realize or serve K???a, just as Arjuna did. Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his K???a realization, he accepted the instruction of K???a and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised inBhagavad-g?t?. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases. Generally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service. Devotional service to K???a without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service � chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc. � as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without unwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-g?t? such research work and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-g?t?, one should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand the self. That is recommended here. As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. So bhakti, or devotional service, is eternal. One should be established in that philosophical conviction. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (1.2.11) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva? yaj j�?nam advayam. �Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Param?tm? and Bhagav?n.� Bhagav?n is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge. Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground ?oor and going up to the top ?oor. Now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the ?rst ?oor, the second or the third ?oor, etc., but unless one reaches the top ?oor, which is the understanding of K???a, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility, understanding is not truly possible. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, he still thinks, �I am God� because of ignorance. The beginning of knowledge, therefore, is am?nitva, humility. One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of this truth.",

Now He begins to explain the knowable, ?rst the soul and then the Supersoul. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also con?rmed here. There is no speci?c date at which the j?va was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the j?v?tm?�s manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature con?rms this: na j?yate mriyate v? vipa?cit (Ka?ha Upani?ad 1.2.18). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 6.16) to bepradh?na-k?etraj�a-patir gu?e?a?, the chief knower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature. In the sm?ti it is said, d?sa-bh?to harer eva n?nyasvaiva kad?cana. The living entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also con?rmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings.

He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the ?rst great teacher, Brahm?, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-g?t? the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a ?ower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In the Brahma-sa?hit? (5.37) it is stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhil?tma-bh?ta?: although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading.

Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in conditioned life they are covered with the material elements, and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The Supreme Lord�s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirgu?a. Gu?a means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the ?vet??vatara Upani?ad (3.19) in the verse ap??i-p?do javano grah?t?. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacri?ce is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes � otherwise how could He see? He sees everything � past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also con?rmed in Bhagavad-g?t?: He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature. Bhagavad-g?t? also con?rms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy, because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we ?nd that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form, called sac-cid-?nanda-vigraha. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can see the Lord�s form.

One Vedic mantra (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 6.18) says, ta? ha devam ?tma-buddhi-prak??a? mumuk?ur vai ?ara?am aha? prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned, it is also con?rmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditv?ti m?tyum eti. �Only by knowing Him can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.� (?vet??vatara Upani?ad 3.8) He is situated in everyone�s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the ?eld of activity � the individual soul and the Supersoul � must be admitted. One�s hands and legs are distributed locally, but K???a�s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is con?rmed in the ?vet??vatara Upani?ad (3.17):sarvasya prabhum ???na? sarvasya ?ara?a? b?hat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is theprabhu, or master, of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different.",

      "purport" : "The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of knowing. Combined, these are called vij�?na, or the science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in K???a consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to K???a�s activities and realize that K???a is everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained. Now, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7, beginning from mah?-bh?t?ni and continuing throughcetan? dh?ti?, analyze the material elements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to form the body, or the ?eld of activities. And verses 8 through 12, from am?nitvam through tattva-j�?n?rtha-dar?anam, describe the process of knowledge for understanding both types of knower of the ?eld of activities, namely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18, beginning from an?di mat-param and continuing through h?di sarvasya vi??hitam, describe the soul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul. Thus three items have been described: the ?eld of activity (the body), the process of understanding, and both the soul and the Supersoul. It is especially described here that only the unalloyed devotees of the Lord can understand these three items clearly. So for these devotees Bhagavad-g?t? is fully useful; it is they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord, K???a. In other words, only devotees, and not others, can understandBhagavad-g?t? and derive the desired result.",

      "purport" : "By the knowledge given in this chapter, one can understand the body (the ?eld of activities) and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and the Supersoul). The body is the ?eld of activity and is composed of material nature. The individual soul that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the body is the puru?a, or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion. Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities are of the superior energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah?-vi??u, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of the mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are averse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But with the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all transformations and in?uences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the same.",

      "purport" : "The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are creations of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total � body and instrument senses � is offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one�s desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas (Mu??aka Upani?ad 3.1.1) as follows: dv? supar?? sayuj? sakh?ya?. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul, or Param?tm?.",

      "purport" : "This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the in?uence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the in?uence of material nature. How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K???a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K???a consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K???a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedicmantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.",

      "purport" : "It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity. Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the Param?tm? in every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para,transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular ?eld, but the Supersoul is present not as ?nite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name is Param?tm?, not ?tm?, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that the ?tm? and Param?tm? are different. The Supersoul, the Param?tm?, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because the Param?tm? is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul�s desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhukta, or the sustained, and the Lord is bhokt?, or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend. The fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has this tendency he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated inBhagavad-g?t?, and from within He tries to convince the living entity that his activities in the material ?eld are not conducive to real happiness. �Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy,� He says.

Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding. But there are others, who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called introspective devotees, philosophers, and workers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are best situated in spiritual understanding, because they understand that beyond this material nature are the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is expanded as the Param?tm?, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the class of the faithful. The S??khya philosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-?fth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in K???a consciousness. Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in K???a consciousness.

Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K???a consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything.

Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee.

For instance, in Bhagavad-g?t? we ?nd K???a instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations. One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its twenty-four elements. The body is the gross manifestation. And the subtle manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and can also see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master.

As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as the Supreme Person.

However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, in the spiritual world there is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains a spiritual form.

This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation; and that total substance of the material cause, in which there are three modes of nature, is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature (Mu??aka Upani?ad 1.1.19):tasm?d etad brahma n?ma-r?pam anna? ca j?yate. The Supreme Person impregnates that Brahman with the seeds of the living entities. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, ?re and air, are all material energy, and they constitute what is called mahad brahma, or the great Brahman, the material nature. As explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature � the living entity. Into material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature. The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature.

All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities� conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-g?t?. The mode of goodness is ?rst considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the br?hma?a, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness. The dif?culty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world.

      "purport" : "The result of pious activities in the mode of goodness is pure. Therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. But activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The ?nancier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil. The miseries are there. ThusBhagavad-g?t? says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is de?nitely great misery. There may be a little so-called mental happiness � �I have this house or this money� � but this is not actual happiness. As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, m?y?, the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant�s being killed. One has to pay for it. So indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals, because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature (?g Veda 9.46.4) the wordsgobhi? pr??ita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satis?ed by milk, is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states: namo brahma?ya-dev?ya go-br?hma?a-hit?ya ca jagad-dhit?ya k????ya govind?ya namo nama? �My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the br?hma?as, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.� (Vi??u Pur??a 1.19.65) The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the br?hma?as. Br?hma?as are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the br?hma?as and the cows, must be given all protection � that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K???a consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.",

We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring us to this. The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth, in the mode of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life. The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in material nature.

      "purport" : "Arjuna submitted three different questions, and the Lord answers them one after another. In these verses, K???a ?rst indicates that a person transcendentally situated has no envy and does not hanker for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense grati?cation, but when one transfers the consciousness to K???a, sense grati?cation automatically stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the in?uence of the modes of material nature. The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in K???a consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in K???a consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of K???a consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence. Social and political issues do not affect him, because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt anything for K???a, but for his personal self he does not attempt anything. By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 14",
      "purport" : "This verse is a reply to Arjuna�s third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K???a activities. K???a activities are known as bhakti-yoga � always acting for K???a. This includes not only K???a, but His different plenary expansions such as R?ma and N?r?ya?a. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of K???a, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K???a are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of K???a or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very dif?cult to overcome, one can overcome them easily. This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K???a at once surmounts the in?uence of the modes of material nature. To be in K???a consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality with K???a. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity, in his spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as K???a in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there, and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the quali?cations. Thus the quali?cation is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahm?py eti. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as an individual soul.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 14",
      "purport" : "The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Param?tm?, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Param?tm? and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the ?rst stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param?tm? realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kum?ras were situated ?rst in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said, raso vai sa?, rasa? hy ev?ya? labdhv?nand? bhavati: �When one understands the Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of pleasure, K???a, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.� (Taittir?ya Upani?ad 2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service. The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature � goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K???a consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering � the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service � should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the in?uence of the spiritual master, one�s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes ?rmly situated in the Lord�s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the ?owers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahma-jyotir or the different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.",

      "purport" : "After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, �What about the Vedas?� It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand K???a. Therefore one who is in K???a consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas. The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree�s roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahm? is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it. This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities� activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense grati?cation and liberation. Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank re?ect upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a re?ection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This re?ection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as a tree�s re?ection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things� being situated in this re?ected material light. One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he can cut off his relationship with it. This tree, being the re?ection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to S??khya philosophy, come prak?ti, puru?a, then the three gu?as, then the ?ve gross elements (pa�ca-mah?-bh?ta), then the ten senses (da?endriya), mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world into twenty-four elements. If Brahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted re?ection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The prak?ti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puru?a is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-g?t?. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A re?ection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the re?ection is re?ected is eternal. The material re?ection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this re?ected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world.",

In the lower parts, there are variegated manifestations of living entities � human beings, animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature. Sometimes we ?nd that a tract of land is barren for want of suf?cient water, and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where particular modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested accordingly. The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of the different modes of nature we develop different senses, and by the senses we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The tips of the branches are the senses � the ears, nose, eyes, etc. � which are attached to the enjoyment of different sense objects. The twigs are sound, form, touch, and so on � the sense objects. The subsidiary roots are attachments and aversions, which are by-products of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to develop from these secondary roots, which spread in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka, and the other roots are in the human planetary systems.

      "purport" : "It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be understood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of the real tree is at the other end. When entangled with the material expansions of the tree, one cannot see how far the tree extends, nor can one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to ?nd out the cause. �I am the son of my father, my father is the son of such-and-such a person, etc.� By searching in this way, one comes to Brahm?, who is generated by the Garbhodaka-??y? Vi??u. Finally, in this way, when one reaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search out that origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the association of persons who are in knowledge of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false re?ection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become situated in the real tree. The word asa?ga is very important in this connection because the attachment for sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong. Therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the ?rst thing one must do is surrender to Him. The description of that place whence having gone one never returns to this false re?ected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To gain the favor of that Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of performing devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of the extension of the material world.

When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender.

Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own.

As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge. One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false re?ection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very dif?cult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K???a consciousness there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in K???a consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to K???a consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental. The words parama? mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of six opulences. The Ka?ha Upani?ad (2.2.15) also con?rms that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine, moonshine or stars (na tatra s?ryo bh?ti na candra-t?rakam), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.",

      "purport" : "In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord � eternally. It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, san?tana?. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called vi??u-tattva and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, thevi??u-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord R?ma, N?si?ha-deva, Vi??um?rti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaiku??ha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world. The living entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world � Brahm?, Lord ?iva and even Vi??u � are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word kar?ati (�struggling� or �grappling hard�) is very signi?cant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity. The following information is there in the M?dhyandin?yana-?ruti: sa v? e?a brahma-ni??ha ida? ?ar?ra? martyam atis?jya brahm?bhisampadya brahma?? pa?yati brahma?? ???oti brahma?aiveda? sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. From sm?ti also it is understood, vasanti yatra puru??? sarve vaiku??ha-m?rtaya?: in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead�s. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the expansions of vi??u-m?rti. In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words mamaiv???a? (�fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord�) are also very signi?cant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here, because the Sanskrit word san?tana (�eternal�) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that in each and every individual body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present (dehino �smin yath? dehe). That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one with the Lord, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.",

Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body.

Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power to understand their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it.

Everyone sees the sun, moon, ?re and electricity. One should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or ?re are coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K???a consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also, but in each universe there is only one sun. As stated in Bhagavad-g?t? (10.21), the moon is one of the stars (nak?atr???m aha? ?a??). Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set ?re to prepare their foodstuff, they set ?re to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of ?re. Therefore sunrise, ?re and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and ?re are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a, then one�s K???a consciousness will begin.

Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is worshipable not only as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the localized Param?tm?, but as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well.

If one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then K???a gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand K???a. Vedic literature con?rms this: yo �sau sarvair vedair g?yate.

The Vedas give us direction by which to understand K???a and the process of realizing Him. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ved?nta-s?tra (1.1.4) con?rms this in the following words: tat tu samanvay?t. One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

      "purport" : "As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vy?sadeva compiled the Ved?nta-s?tra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the Ved?nta-s?tra. He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes � the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world they are called j?va-bh?ta, and the Sanskrit words given here, k?ara? sarv??i bh?t?ni, mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in the Ved?nta-s?tra, is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained. According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K???a, there are two classes of living entities. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it. The living entities who are struggling in this world with the mind and ?ve senses have their material bodies, which are changing. As long as a living entity is conditioned, his body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes � birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness. K?ara? sarv??i bh?t?ni: any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the ?rst created being, Brahm?, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.",

Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects.

      "purport" : "There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K???a to be the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K???a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g?t?, this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-g?t? who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same. Vedic knowledge is called ?ruti, learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K???a and His representatives. Here K???a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not suf?cient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g?t? that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ?r? K???a, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas. The word bhajati is very signi?cant. In many places the word bhajati is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full K???a consciousness, in the devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai??ava parampar? it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K???a, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the point, because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding. But if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that K???a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.",

      "purport" : "The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona ?de spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance. Everyone must take to this consciousness of K???a and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and puri?ed. Unless one comes to this position of understanding K???a and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent. The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is signi?cant. Anagha, �O sinless one,� means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very dif?cult to understand K???a. One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness. While one is performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full K???a consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart. The ?rst falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart. In this chapter the ?rst ?ve verses describe the process of freeing oneself from these weaknesses of heart, and the rest of the chapter, from the sixth verse through the end, discusses puru?ottama-yoga. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifteenth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter ofPuru?ottama-yoga, the Yoga of the Supreme Person.",

      "chapter" : "Chapter 16",
      "purport" : "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as daiv? prak?ti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities. The word abhij?tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very signi?cant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh?dh?na-sa?sk?ra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles recommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-g?t? we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K???a Himself. Sex life is not condemned, provided the process is used in K???a consciousness. Those who are in K???a consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become K???a conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father and mother absorbed in K???a consciousness. The social institution known as var???rama-dharma � the institution dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational divisions or castes � is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational quali?cations. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world. In the var???rama institution the sanny?s?, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. A br?hma?a is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k?atriyas, the vai?yas and the ??dras, but a sanny?s?, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the br?hma?as also. For a sanny?s?, the ?rst quali?cation should be fearlessness. Because a sanny?s? has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one thinks, �After I leave my connections, who will protect me?� he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K???a or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Param?tm? is always within, that He is seeing everything, and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have ?rm conviction that K???a as Param?tm? will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. �I shall never be alone,� one should think. �Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K???a, and He will give me all protection.� That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny?s? is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny?s?, and when He was at Pur? His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sanny?s? not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sanny?s?, intimate relations with women and possession of wealth for sense grati?cation are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny?s? was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of thesanny?sa order of life in connection with association with women. One of His personal associates, namely Cho?a Harid?sa, was associated with Lord Caitanya along with His other con?dential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho?a Harid?sa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, �For a sanny?s? or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense grati?cation � not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity � is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.� So these are the processes for puri?cation. The next item is j�?na-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sanny?s? life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sanny?s? is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the quali?cations of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility thesanny?s? goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K???a consciousness. This is the duty of a sanny?s?. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach K???a consciousness with logic and understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of life without suf?cient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona ?de spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sanny?s?, or one in the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa??uddhi(purity) and j�?na-yoga (knowledge). The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend ?fty percent of their income to propagate K???a consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charity, as will be explained later on � charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K???a consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness. Then as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality, but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K???a. If he is able to beget children who will be in K???a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure. Sacri?ce is another item to be performed by the householders, because sacri?ces require a large amount of money. Those in other orders of life, namely brahmacarya, v?naprastha and sanny?sa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacri?ce is meant for the householders. They should perform agni-hotra sacri?ces as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacri?ces at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacri?ce recommended in this age is calledsa?k?rtana-yaj�a. This sa?k?rtana-yaj�a, the chanting of Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive sacri?ce; everyone can adopt it and derive bene?t. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacri?ce, are meant for the householder. Then sv?dhy?ya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life. Brahmac?r?s should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called sv?dhy?ya. Tapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life � brahmacarya, g?hastha, v?naprasthaand sanny?sa. So after g?hastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-?ve years in student life, twenty-?ve in householder life, twenty-?ve in retired life and twenty-?ve in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire var???rama-dharma society is meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g?t?. Such theories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don�t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas. As far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmac?r? ??rama, g?hastha ??rama, v?naprastha ??rama or sanny?sa ??rama. One should be very simple and straightforward. Ahi?s? means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense grati?cation. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacri?ce. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi?s? means not checking anyone�s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one�s palate. This is called ahi?s?. Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some dif?cult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona ?de spiritual master. That is the process for understanding the Vedas. ?ruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g?t? that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona ?de spiritual master. Akrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai?unam means that one should not ?nd fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not fault?nding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr? means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. Ac?palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word tejas used here is meant for the k?atriyas. The k?atriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it. But a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions show forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses. ?aucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one�s dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. N?ti-m?nit?, not expecting honor, applies to the??dras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the ??dras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order. All these twenty-six quali?cations mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and occupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.",

Especially among the ?ryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples, those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness. As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-sa?hit?, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa?hit?. Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa?hit? it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-sa?hit?. But modern education has arti?cially devised a puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. The social condition of women is thus not very good now, although those who are married are in a better condition than those who are proclaiming their so-called freedom. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.",

They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance, just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence. Then when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation.

He is enamored by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of one�s personal ability. They do not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep � between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world. Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacri?ce of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: �Why are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don�t believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.� These are the demoniac�s preachings. Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and in?uential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more in?uential than he. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yaj�as, or sacri?ces. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaj�a and prepare some machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was R?va?a. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacri?ces, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangements. These are examples of bewilderment.

In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself.

      "purport" : "As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas are meant for knowing K???a. If one understands K???a from the Bhagavad-g?t? and becomes situated in K???a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mah?prabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare K???a, Hare K???a, K???a K???a, Hare Hare/ Hare R?ma, Hare R?ma, R?ma R?ma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in K???a consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of ??stra, or scripture. ??strais without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the ??stra � being above these defects � are accepted without alteration by all great saints, ?c?ryas and great souls. In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classi?ed as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the ??stras is considered fortunate. In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, m?y?, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona ?de spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one�s life becomes successful.

Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant arti?cial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, originally he is nirgu?a, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K???a consciousness. If one is situated in K???a consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the in?uence of the modes of nature. The word ?raddh?, or �faith,� is very signi?cant in this verse. ?raddh?, or faith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One�s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One�s strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works are completely puri?ed. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in puri?ed goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one�s faith is not completely in puri?ed goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one�s faith is established. It should be understood that if one�s heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we ?nd different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we ?nd different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.",

According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their speci?c situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahm?, ?iva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained. Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower-class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacri?ces. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam (4.3.23) it is said, sattva? vi?uddha? vasudeva-?abditam: �When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V?sudeva.� The purport is that those who are completely puri?ed of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship ?ve kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi??u form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi??u. Vi??u is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi??u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahm? is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe ?ve kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be puri?ed through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.",

Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa? is signi?cant in this connection. Persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the wombs of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.",

      "purport" : "The purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life�s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, d?l, whole wheat, etc. Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except pras?dam,food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness. Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was ?rst offered to the Supreme Lord or ?rst eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g?t? the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, ?our and milk when offered with devotion. Patra? pu?pa? phala? toyam.Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the pras?dam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunctions of the scripture and offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

      "purport" : "It has been explained that penance, sacri?ce, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether ?rst class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme � o? tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal � they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, o? tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word o? is always found. One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity, sacri?ce and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the mode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words o? tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., o? tad vi??o?. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, o?is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. O? ity etad brahma?o nedi??ha? n?ma indicates the ?rst goal. Then tat tvam asi (Ch?ndogya Upani?ad 6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya (Ch?ndogya Upani?ad 6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they becomeo? tat sat. Formerly when Brahm?, the ?rst created living entity, performed sacri?ces, he indicated by these three words the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great signi?cance. Bhagavad-g?t? recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for o? tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and sacri?ce with these three words, he is acting in K???a consciousness. K???a consciousness is a scienti?c execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.",

Therefore in this verse it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K???a consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K???a. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K???a consciousness under the guidance of a bona ?de spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful. In the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak?as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K???a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K???a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must ?rst ?nd the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should therefore take to K???a consciousness directly.

In every chapter of Bhagavad-g?t?, Lord K???a stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most con?dential path of knowledge. In the ?rst six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yogin?m api sarve??m � �Of all yog?s or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.� In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the words o? tat sat, which indicate Vi??u, the Supreme Person. The third part of Bhagavad-g?t? has shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past ?c?ryas and the Brahma-s?tra, the Ved?nta-s?tra. Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of Ved?nta-s?tra, but actually theVed?nta-s?tra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Ved?nta-s?tra, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g?t?. As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g?t?, namely renunciation (ty?ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny?sa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words. Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord � H???ke?a and Ke?i-ni??dana � are signi?cant. H???ke?a is K???a, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K???a as Ke?i-ni??dana. Ke?? was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K???a to kill the demon of doubt.",

And as stated in the Seventh Chapter ofBhagavad-g?t?, the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vai??ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted re?ection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Param?tm? is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full K???a consciousness. That is recommended in this verse. Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by H???ke?a, the master of the senses. And by the result of the work in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ?r? K???a, should be worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full K???a consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g?t? (12.7), te??m aha? samuddhart?. The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord he will achieve the highest perfection.",

      "purport" : "One�s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-g?t?. As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of abr?hma?a, k?atriya, vai?ya and ??dra are prescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another�s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by ??dras should not arti?cially claim to be a br?hma?a, although he may have been born into a br?hma?a family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a br?hma?a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a br?hma?a. For a k?atriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a k?atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a k?atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k?atriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br?hma?a. One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k?atriya. He was hesitating to ?ght the other party. But if such ?ghting is performed for the sake of K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business ?eld also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a pro?t. If he does not do so, there can be no pro?t. Sometimes a merchant says, �Oh, my dear customer, for you I am making no pro?t,� but one should know that without pro?t the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a pro?t. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a br?hma?a. That is not recommended. Whether one is a k?atriya, a vai?ya, or a ??dradoesn�t matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br?hma?as, who perform different types of sacri?ce, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacri?ced in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k?atriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yaj�a, or for Vi??u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense grati?cation is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.",

      "purport" : "In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a br?hma?a, he has to perform sacri?ces in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a k?atriya, however pious he may be, has to ?ght enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his pro?t to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a ??dra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these ?aws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature. A very nice example is given herein. Although ?re is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the ?re impure. Even though there is smoke in the ?re, ?re is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a k?atriya and take up the occupation of a br?hma?a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a br?hma?a there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of ?re and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the ?re, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the ?re despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K???a consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are puri?ed. When the results of work are puri?ed, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization.",

      "purport" : "To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bh?ta stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further, to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bh?ta, oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense. In the material concept of life, when one works for sense grati?cation, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in K???a consciousness has nothing for which to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God�s service, in K???a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than K???a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living entity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bh?ta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one�s individuality becomes hellish, the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like serpents whose poison teeth are broken. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku??ha, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more signi?cant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age.",

If anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. As already stated in Bhagavad-g?t? (7.25), n?ha? prak??a? sarvasya: He is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in K???a consciousness and devotional service can understand what K???a is. University degrees are not helpful. One who is fully conversant with the K???a science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K???a. Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure K???a consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the word vi?ate, �enters into Me,� supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. Vi?ate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in one�s individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river ?owing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We ?nd so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not suf?cient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths. Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is con?rmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom. After attainment of the brahma-bh?ta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one�s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bh?ta stage develops, and material contamination � greediness and lust for sense enjoyment � disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam also. After liberation the process of bhakti, or transcendental service, continues. The Ved?nta-s?tra (4.1.12) con?rms this: ?-pr?ya??t tatr?pi hi d???am. This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the ?r?mad-Bh?gavatam, real devotional liberation is de?ned as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is a part-and-parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life.",

      "purport" : "The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge and processes of religion � knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-g?t?, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to K???a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him. In the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K???a. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to ?r? K???a he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K???a as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him. The process of surrender to K???a is described in the Hari-bhakti-vil?sa (11.676): ?nuk?lyasya sa?kalpa? pr?tik?lyasya varjanam rak?i?yat?ti vi?v?so gopt?tve vara?a? tath? ?tma-nik?epa-k?rpa?ye ?a?-vidh? ?ara??gati? According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of K???a consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K???a consciousness should be avoided. One should be con?dent that in all circumstances K???a will protect him from all dif?culties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. K???a will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider K???a the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full K???a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and puri?catory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto K???a does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto K???a will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reactions. One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K???a. His name is K???a because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of K???a is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists � some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K???a Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to K???a, in full consciousness, is the most con?dential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-g?t?. Karma-yog?s, empiric philosophers, mystics and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here, m? ?uca?, �Don�t fear, don�t hesitate, don�t worry,� are very signi?cant.

      "purport" : "The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-discipline. ?r? Caitanya Mah?prabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity�s constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusory m?y? or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of m?y? to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K???a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word moha is very important in this verse. Moha refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in K???a consciousness. K???a consciousness is acting according to K???a�s order. A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of m?y?. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-g?t? from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that K???a was not only his friend but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood K???a factually. So to study Bhagavad-g?t? is to understand K???a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to K???a. When Arjuna understood that it was K???a�s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to ?ght according to K???a�s desire. He again took up his weapons � his arrows and bow � to ?ght under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

This means that one has to understand K???a not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is still direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona ?de, then one can hear Bhagavad-g?t? directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yog?s all over the world, but K???a is the master of all yoga systems. K???a�s instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-g?t? � surrender unto K???a. One who does so is the topmost yog?. This is con?rmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Yogin?m api sarve??m. N?rada is the direct disciple of K???a and the spiritual master of Vy?sa. Therefore Vy?sa is as bona ?de as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sa�jaya is the direct disciple of Vy?sa. Therefore by the grace of Vy?sa, Sa�jaya�s senses were puri?ed, and he could see and hear K???a directly. One who directly hears K???a can understand this con?dential knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K???a; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-g?t? is concerned. In Bhagavad-g?t?, all the yoga systems � karma-yoga, j�?na-yoga and bhakti-yoga � are explained. K???a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K???a directly, so, by the grace of Vy?sa, Sa�jaya was also able to hear K???a directly. Actually there is no difference between hearing directly from K???a and hearing directly from K???a via a bona ?de spiritual master like Vy?sa.

      "chapter" : "Chapter 18",
      "purport" : "The Bhagavad-g?t? began with an inquiry of Dh?tar???ra�s. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bh??ma, Dro?a and Kar?a. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battle?eld, Sa�jaya told the King, �You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K???a and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.� He directly con?rmed that Dh?tar???ra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K???a was there. K???a�s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K???a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K???a is also the master of renunciation. The ?ght was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi??hira. Arjuna was ?ghting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi??hira. Because K???a and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi??hira, Yudhi??hira�s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sa�jaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi??hira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi??hira, after gaining victory in this battle, would ?ourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life. There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g?t? to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battle?eld. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K???a incited Arjuna to ?ght, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g?t? is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: man-man? bhava mad-bhakta?. One must become a devotee of K???a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K???a (sarva-dharm?n parityajya m?m eka? ?ara?a? vraja). The instructions of Bhagavad-g?t? constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the G?t? is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K???a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter. From Bhagavad-g?t? we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K???a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings ofBhagavad-g?t?. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a con?dential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are con?dential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more con?dential. And surrender unto K???a in devotional service in full K???a consciousness is the most con?dential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter. Another feature of Bhagavad-g?t? is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features � impersonal Brahman, localized Param?tm?, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K???a. If one understands K???a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K???a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K???a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible. In Bhagavad-g?t? ?ve principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K???a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth � impersonal Brahman, localized Param?tm? and any other transcendental conception � exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although super?cially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya�s philosophy is that of �inconceivable oneness and difference.� This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K???a may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K???a, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K???a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the ?r?mad Bhagavad-g?t? in the matter of its Conclusion � the Perfection of Renunciation.  ",

      "text" : "dehī nityam avadhyo 'yaṁ dehe sarvasya bhārata tasmāt sarvāṇi bhūtāni na tvaṁ śocitum arhasi  The very first step in self-realization is realizing one's identity as separate from the body. \"I am not this body but am spirit soul\" is an essential realization for anyone who wants to transcend death and enter into the spiritual world beyond. It is not simply a matter of saying \"I am not this body,\" but of actually realizing it. This is not as simple as it may seem at first. Although we are not these bodies but are pure consciousness, somehow or other we have become encased within the bodily dress. If we actually want the happiness and independence that transcend death, we have to establish ourselves and remain in our constitutional position as pure consciousness.  Living in the bodily conception, our idea of happiness is like that of a man in delirium. Some philosophers claim that this delirious condition of bodily identification should be cured by abstaining from all action. Because these material activities have been a source of distress for us, they claim that we should actually stop these activities. Their culmination of perfection is in a kind of Buddhistic nirvāṇa, in which no activities are performed. Buddha maintained that due to a combination of material elements, this body has come into existence, and that somehow or other if these material elements are separated or dismantled, the cause of suffering is removed. If the tax collectors give us too much difficulty because we happen to possess a large house, one simple solution is to destroy the house. However, Bhagavad-gītā indicates that this material body is not all in all. Beyond this combination of material elements, there is spirit, and the symptom of that spirit is consciousness.  Consciousness cannot be denied. A body without consciousness is a dead body. As soon as consciousness is removed from the body, the mouth will not speak, the eye will not see, nor the ears hear. A child can understand that. It is a fact that consciousness is absolutely necessary for the animation of the body. What is this consciousness? Just as heat or smoke are symptoms of fire, so consciousness is the symptom of the soul. The energy of the soul, or self, is produced in the shape of consciousness. Indeed, consciousness proves that the soul is present. This is not only the philosophy of Bhagavad-gītā but the conclusion of all Vedic literature."
    }, {
      "text" : "The impersonalist followers of Śaṅkarācārya, as well as the Vaiṣṇavas following in the disciplic succession from Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, acknowledge the factual existence of the soul, but the Buddhist philosophers do not. The Buddhists contend that at a certain stage the combination of matter produces consciousness, but this argument is refuted by the fact that although we may have all the constituents of matter at our disposal, we cannot produce consciousness from them. All the material elements may be present in a dead man, but we cannot revive that man to consciousness. This body is not like a machine. When a part of a machine breaks down, it can be replaced, and the machine will work again, but when the body breaks down and consciousness leaves the body, there is no possibility of our replacing the broken part and rejuvenating the consciousness. The soul is different from the body, and as long as the soul is there, the body is animate. But there is no possibility of making the body animate in the absence of the soul.  Because we cannot perceive the soul by our gross senses, we deny it. Actually there are so many things that are there which we cannot see. We cannot see air, radio waves, or sound, nor can we perceive minute bacteria with our blunt senses, but this does not mean they are not there. By the aid of the microscope and other instruments, many things can be perceived which had previously been denied by the imperfect senses. Just because the soul, which is atomic in size, has not been perceived yet by senses or instruments, we should not conclude that it is not there. It can, however, be perceived by its symptoms and effects.  In Bhagavad-gītā Śrī Kṛṣṇa points out that all of our miseries are due to false identification with the body.  mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ āgamāpāyino 'nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata  In the summertime we may feel pleasure from contact with water, but in the winter we may shun that very water because it is too cold. In either case, the water is the same, but we perceive it as pleasant or painful due to its contact with the body."
    }, {
      "text" : "All feelings of distress and happiness are due to the body. Under certain conditions the body and mind feel happiness and distress. Factually we are hankering after happiness, for the soul's constitutional position is that of happiness. The soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Being, who is sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. 5.1]—the embodiment of knowledge, bliss, and eternity. Indeed, the very name Kṛṣṇa, which is nonsectarian, means \"the greatest pleasure.\" Kṛṣ means \"greatest,\" and ṇa means \"pleasure.\" Kṛṣṇa is the epitome of pleasure, and being part and parcel of Him, we hanker for pleasure. A drop of ocean water has all the properties of the ocean itself, and we, although minute particles of the Supreme Whole, have the same energetic properties as the Supreme.  The atomic soul, although so small, is moving the entire body to act in so many wonderful ways. In the world we see so many cities, highways, bridges, great buildings, monuments, and great civilizations, but who has done all this? It is all done by the minute spirit spark within the body. If such wonderful things can be performed by the minute spirit spark, we cannot begin to imagine what can be accomplished by the Supreme Spirit Whole. The natural hankering of the minute spirit spark is for the qualities of the whole—knowledge, bliss, and eternality—but these hankerings are being frustrated due to the material body. The information on how to attain the soul's desire is given in Bhagavad-gītā.  At present we are trying to attain eternity, bliss, and knowledge by means of an imperfect instrument. Actually, our progress toward these goals is being blocked by the material body; therefore we have to come to the realization of our existence beyond the body. Theoretical knowledge that we are not these bodies will not do. We have to keep ourselves always separate as masters of the body, not as servants. If we know how to drive a car well, it will give us good service; but if we do not know how, we will be in danger."
    }, {
      "text" : "The body is composed of senses, and the senses are always hungry after their objects. The eyes see a beautiful person and tell us, \"Oh, there is a beautiful girl, a beautiful boy. Let's go see.\" The ears are telling us, \"Oh, there is very nice music. Let us go hear it.\" The tongue is saying, \"Oh, there is a very nice restaurant with palatable dishes. Let us go.\" In this way the senses are dragging us from one place to another, and because of this we are perplexed.  indriyāṇāṁ hi caratāṁ yan mano 'nuvidhīyate tad asya harati prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi  It is imperative that we learn how to control the senses. The name gosvāmī is given to someone who has learned how to master the senses. Go means \"senses,\" and svāmī means \"controller\"; so one who can control the senses is to be considered a gosvāmī. Kṛṣṇa indicates that one who identifies with the illusory material body cannot establish himself in his proper identity as spirit soul. Bodily pleasure is flickering and intoxicating, and we cannot actually enjoy it, because of its momentary nature. Actual pleasure is of the soul, not the body. We have to mold our lives in such a way that we will not be diverted by bodily pleasure. If somehow we are diverted, it is not possible for us to establish our consciousness in its true identity beyond the body.  bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām vyavasāyātmikā buddhiḥ samādhau na vidhīyate  traiguṇya-viṣayā vedā nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho niryoga-kṣema ātmavān  The word veda means \"book of knowledge.\" There are many books of knowledge, which vary according to the country, population, environment, etc. In India the books of knowledge are referred to as the Vedas. In the West they are called the Old Testament and New Testament. The Muhammadans accept the Koran. What is the purpose for all these books of knowledge? They are to train us to understand our position as pure soul. Their purpose is to restrict bodily activities by certain rules and regulations, and these rules and regulations are known as codes of morality."

      "text" : "The Bible, for instance, has ten commandments intended to regulate our lives. The body must be controlled in order for us to reach the highest perfection, and without regulative principles, it is not possible to perfect our lives. The regulative principles may differ from country to country or from scripture to scripture, but that doesn't matter, for they are made according to the time and circumstances and the mentality of the people. But the principle of regulated control is the same. Similarly, the government sets down certain regulations to be obeyed by its citizens. There is no possibility of making advancement in government or civilization without some regulations. In the previous verse, Śrī Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that the regulative principles of the Vedas are meant to control the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion, and ignorance (traiguṇya-viṣayā vedāḥ). However, Kṛṣṇa is advising Arjuna to establish himself in his pure constitutional position as spirit soul, beyond the dualities of material nature.  As we have already pointed out, these dualities—such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain—arise due to the contact of the senses with their objects. In other words, they are born of identification with the body. Kṛṣṇa indicates that those who are devoted to enjoyment and power are carried away by the words of the Vedas, which promise heavenly enjoyment by sacrifice and regulated activity. Enjoyment is our birthright, for it is the characteristic of the spirit soul, but the spirit soul tries to enjoy materially, and this is the mistake.  Everyone is turning to material subjects for enjoyment and is compiling as much knowledge as possible. Someone is becoming a chemist, physicist, politician, artist, or whatever. Everyone knows something of everything or everything of something, and this is generally known as knowledge. But as soon as we leave the body, all of this knowledge is vanquished. In a previous life one may have been a great man of knowledge, but in this life he has to start again by going to school and learning how to read and write from the beginning. Whatever knowledge was acquired in the previous life is forgotten. The situation is that we are actually seeking eternal knowledge, but this cannot be acquired by this material body. We are all seeking enjoyment through these bodies, but bodily enjoyment is not our actual enjoyment. It is artificial. We have to understand that if we want to continue in this artificial enjoyment, we will not be able to attain our position of eternal enjoyment."

A diseased man cannot enjoy himself properly; a man with jaundice, for instance, will taste sugar candy as bitter, but a healthy man can taste its sweetness. In either case, the sugar candy is the same, but according to our condition it tastes different. Unless we are cured of this diseased conception of bodily life, we cannot taste the sweetness of spiritual life. Indeed, it will taste bitter to us. At the same time, by increasing our enjoyment of material life, we are further complicating our diseased condition. A typhoid patient cannot eat solid food, and if someone gives it to him to enjoy, and he eats it, he is further complicating his malady and is endangering his life. If we really want freedom from the miseries of material existence, we must minimize our bodily demands and pleasures.  Actually, material enjoyment is not enjoyment at all. Real enjoyment does not cease. In the Mahābhārata there is a verse—ramante yogino 'nante—to the effect that the yogīs (yogino), those who are endeavoring to elevate themselves to the spiritual platform, are actually enjoying (ramante), but their enjoyment is anante, endless. This is because their enjoyment is in relation to the supreme enjoyer (Rāma), Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the real enjoyer, and Bhagavad-gītā (5.29) confirms this:  bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati  Bhoga means \"enjoyment,\" and our enjoyment comes from understanding our position as the enjoyed.

The word pri means \"woman.\" Puruṣa, or spirit, is the subject, and prakṛti, or nature, is the object. The enjoyment, however, is participated in both by the husband and the wife. When actual enjoyment is there, there is no distinction that the husband is enjoying more or the wife is enjoying less. Although the male is the predominator and the female is the predominated, there is no division when it comes to enjoyment. On a larger scale, no living entity is the enjoyer.  God expanded into many, and we constitute those expansions. God is one without a second, but He willed to become many in order to enjoy. We have experience that there is little or no enjoyment in sitting alone in a room talking to oneself. However, if there are five people present, our enjoyment is enhanced, and if we can discuss Kṛṣṇa before many, many people, the enjoyment is all the greater. Enjoyment means variety. God became many for His enjoyment, and thus our position is that of the enjoyed. That is our constitutional position and the purpose for our creation. Both enjoyer and enjoyed have consciousness, but the consciousness of the enjoyed is subordinate to the consciousness of the enjoyer. Although Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer and we the enjoyed, the enjoyment can be participated in equally by everyone. Our enjoyment can be perfected when we participate in the enjoyment of God. There is no possibility of our enjoying separately on the bodily platform. Material enjoyment on the gross bodily platform is discouraged throughout Bhagavad-gītā.  mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ āgamāpāyino 'nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata"

As mentioned in the previous chapter, originally we are all connected to the Supreme Lord, but now we have been affected by material contamination. The process is that we have to return to the spiritual world, and that process of linking up is called yoga. Another meaning of the word yoga is \"plus.\" At the present moment we are minus God, or minus the Supreme. When we add Kṛṣṇa—or God—to our lives, this human form of life becomes perfect.  At the time of death we have to finish that process of perfection. During our lifetime we have to practice the method of approaching that perfection so that at the time of death, when we have to give up this material body, that perfection can be realized.  prayāṇa-kāle manasācalena bhaktyā yukto yoga-balena caiva bhruvor madhye prāṇam āveśya samyak sa taṁ paraṁ puruṣam upaiti divyam  Just as a student studies a subject for four or five years and then takes his examination and receives a degree, similarly, with the subject of life, if we practice during our lives for the examination at the time of death, and if we pass the examination, we are transferred to the spiritual world.

Similarly, the ears are accustomed to hearing so many sounds in the world, but at the moment of death one has to hear the transcendental oṁkāra from within.  oṁ ity ekākṣaraṁ brahma vyāharan mām anusmaran yaḥ prayāti tyajan dehaṁ sa yāti paramāṁ gatim"

The mind is very turbulent, but it has to be fixed on the Lord in the heart. When the mind is fixed within the heart and the life air is transferred to the top of the head, one can attain perfection of yoga.  At this point the yogī determines where he is to go. In the material universe there are innumerable planets, and beyond this universe there is the spiritual universe. The yogīs have information of these places from Vedic literatures. Just as one going to America can get some idea what the country is like by reading books, one can also have knowledge of the spiritual planets by reading Vedic literatures. The yogī knows all these descriptions, and he can transfer himself to any planet he likes, without the help of spaceships. Space travel by mechanical means is not the accepted process for elevation to other planets. Perhaps with a great deal of time, effort, and money a few men may be able to reach other planets by material means—spaceships, space suits, etc.—but this is a very cumbersome and impractical method. In any case, it is not possible to go beyond the material universe by mechanical means.  The generally accepted method for transferral to higher planets is the practice of the meditational yoga system or jñāna system. The bhakti-yoga system, however, is not to be practiced for transferral to any material planet, for those who are servants of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, are not interested in any planets in this material world because they know that on whatever planet one enters in the material sky, the four principles of birth, old age, disease, and death are present. On higher planets, the duration of life may be longer than on this earth, but death is there nonetheless. By \"material universe\" we refer to those planets where birth, old age, disease, and death reside, and by \"spiritual universe\" we refer to those planets where there is no birth, old age, disease, and death. Those who are intelligent do not try to elevate themselves to any planet within the material universe."

      "text" : "If one tries to enter higher planets by mechanical means, instant death is assured, for the body cannot stand the radical changes in atmosphere. But if one attempts to go to higher planets by means of the yoga system, he will acquire a suitable body for entrance. We can see this demonstrated on this earth, for we know it is not possible for us to live in the sea, in a watery atmosphere, nor is it possible for aquatics to live on the earth. As we understand that even on this planet one has to have a particular type of body to live in a particular place, so a particular type of body is required for other planets. On the higher planets, bodies live much longer than on earth, for six months on earth is equal to one day on the higher planets. Thus the Vedas describe that those who live on higher planets live upward to ten thousand earth years. Yet despite such a long life span, death awaits everyone. Even if one lives twenty thousand or fifty thousand or even millions of years, in the material world the years are all counted, and death is there. How can we escape this subjugation by death? That is the lesson of Bhagavad-gītā.  na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇo na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre  We are spirit soul, and as such we are eternal. Why, then, should we subject ourselves to birth and death? One who asks this question is to be considered intelligent. Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious are very intelligent, because they are not interested in gaining entrance to any planet where there is death. They will reject a long duration of life in order to attain a body like God's. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. 5.1]. Sat means \"eternal,\" cit means \"full of knowledge,\" and ānanda means \"full of pleasure.\" Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure. If we transfer ourselves from this body into the spiritual world—either to Kṛṣṇaloka (Kṛṣṇa's planet) or any other spiritual planet—we will receive a similar sac-cid-ānanda body. Thus the aim of those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is different from those who are trying to promote themselves to higher planets within this material world."

Having attained this, the yogī can transfer himself to any planet in the material world, according to his desire. If the yogī is curious to know what the moon is like, he can transfer himself there, or if he is interested in higher planets, he can transfer himself there, just as travelers go to New York, Canada, or other cities on the earth. Wherever one goes on earth, he finds the same visa and customs systems operating, and on all the material planets one can similarly see the principles of birth, old age, disease, and death operating.  Oṁ ity ekākṣaraṁ brahma: at the point of death the yogī can pronounce oṁ, oṁkāra, the concise form of transcendental sound vibration. If the yogī can vibrate this sound and at the same time remember Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu (mām anusmaran), he attains the highest goal. It is the process of yoga to concentrate the mind on Viṣṇu. The impersonalists imagine some form of the Supreme Lord, but the personalists do not imagine this; they actually see. Whether one imagines Him or actually sees Him, one has to concentrate his mind on the personal form of Kṛṣṇa.  ananya-cetāḥ satataṁ yo māṁ smarati nityaśaḥ tasyāhaṁ sulabhaḥ pārtha nitya-yuktasya yoginaḥ  Those who are satisfied with temporary life, temporary pleasure, and temporary facilities are not to be considered intelligent, at least not according to Bhagavad-gītā. According to the Gītā, one whose brain substance is very small is interested in temporary things. We are eternal, so why should we be interested in temporary things? No one wants a nonpermanent situation. If we are living in an apartment and the landlord asks us to vacate, we are sorry, but we are not sorry if we move into a better apartment. It is our nature, because we are permanent, to want permanent residence. We don't wish to die, because in actuality we are permanent. Nor do we want to grow old or be diseased, because these are all external or nonpermanent states. Although we are not meant to suffer from fever, sometimes fever comes, and we have to take precautions and remedies to get well again. The fourfold miseries are like a fever, and they are all due to the material body. If somehow we can get out of the material body, we can escape the miseries that are integral with it."

In this way they can be assured of transmigration into the spiritual world. However, although they may enter the spiritual world, they cannot enter into any of the planets there. They remain outside, in the brahma-jyotir. The brahma-jyotir may be compared to the sunshine, and the spiritual planets may be compared to the sun itself. In the spiritual sky the impersonalists remain in the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, the brahma-jyotir. The impersonalists are placed in the brahma-jyotir as spiritual sparks, and in this way the brahma-jyotir is filled with spiritual sparks. This is what is meant by merging into the spiritual existence. It should not be considered that one merges into the brahma-jyotir in the sense of becoming one with it; the individuality of the spiritual spark is retained, but because the impersonalist does not want to take a personal form, he is found as a spiritual spark in that effulgence. Just as the sunshine is composed of so many atomic particles, so the brahma-jyotir is composed of so many spiritual sparks.  However, as living entities we want enjoyment. Being, in itself, is not enough. We want bliss (ānanda) as well as being (sat). In his entirety, the living entity is composed of three qualities—eternality, knowledge, and bliss. Those who enter impersonally into the brahma-jyotir can remain there for some time in full knowledge that they are now merged homogeneously with Brahman, but they cannot have that eternal ānanda, bliss, because that part is wanting. One may remain alone in a room for some time and may enjoy himself by reading a book or engaging in some thought, but it is not possible to remain in that room for years and years at a time, and certainly not for all eternity. Therefore, for one who merges impersonally into the existence of the Supreme, there is every chance of falling down again into the material world in order to acquire some association. This is the verdict of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Astronauts may travel thousands and thousands of miles, but if they do not find rest on some planet, they have to return again to earth. In any case, rest is required. In the impersonal form, rest is uncertain. Therefore Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam says that even after so much endeavor, if the impersonalist enters into the spiritual world and acquires an impersonal form, he returns again into the material world because of neglecting to serve the Supreme Lord in love and devotion. As long as we are here on earth, we must learn to practice to love and serve Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord. If we learn this, we can enter into those spiritual planets. The impersonalist's position in the spiritual world is nonpermanent, for out of loneliness he will attempt to acquire some association. Because he does not associate personally with the Supreme Lord, he has to return again to the world and associate with conditioned living entities there."

When we are left alone for a long time in the impersonal brahma-jyotir, we cannot have pleasure, and therefore we accept the pleasure given by the material world. But in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, real pleasure is enjoyed. In the material world it is generally accepted that the highest pleasure is sex. This is a perverted reflection of the sex pleasure in the spiritual world, the pleasure of association with Kṛṣṇa. But we should not think that the pleasure there is like the sex pleasure in the material world. No, it is different. But unless sex life is there in the spiritual world, it cannot be reflected here. Here it is simply a perverted reflection, but the actual life is there in Kṛṣṇa, who is full of all pleasure. Therefore, the best process is to train ourselves now, so that at the time of death we may transfer ourselves to the spiritual universe, to Kṛṣṇaloka, and there associate with Kṛṣṇa. In Brahma-saṁhitā (5.29) Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His abode are described thus:  cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa- lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi  This is a description of Kṛṣṇaloka. The houses are made of what is called \"touchstone.\" Whatever touchstone touches immediately turns into gold. The trees are wish-fulfilling trees, or \"desire trees,\" for one can receive from them whatever he wishes. In this world we get mangoes from mango trees and apples from apple trees, but there from any tree one can get whatever he desires. Similarly, the cows are called surabhi, and they yield an endless supply of milk. These are descriptions of the spiritual planets found in Vedic scriptures."

Those who are intelligent, however, are not concerned with the fourfold miseries of material life, but with elevation to the spiritual planets. One who is continuously in trance (nitya-yuktasya yoginaḥ) does not divert his attention to anything else. He is always situated in trance. His mind is always filled with the thought of Kṛṣṇa, without deviation (ananya-cetāḥ satatam). Satatam refers to anywhere and any time.  In India I lived in Vṛndāvana, and now I am in America, but this does not mean that I am out of Vṛndāvana, because if I think of Kṛṣṇa always, then I'm always in Vṛndāvana, regardless of the material designation. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means that one always lives with Kṛṣṇa on that spiritual planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana, and that one is simply waiting to give up this material body. Smarati nityaśaḥ means \"continuously remembering,\" and for one who is continuously remembering Kṛṣṇa, the Lord becomes tasyāhaṁ sulabhaḥ—easily purchased.

By penances, austerities, and meditations they can rise up to the platform of the Supreme Absolute, but as has been explained, they again fall down to the material world, because they have not taken Kṛṣṇa's personal features seriously. Unless one worships the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, he again has to descend to the material platform. The ideal attitude should be, \"I am Your eternal servitor. Please let me somehow engage in Your service.\" Kṛṣṇa is called ajitaḥ—unconquerable—for no one can conquer God, but according to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, one with this attitude easily conquers the Supreme. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also recommends that we give up this futile process to measure the Supreme. We cannot even measure the limitations of space, what to speak of the Supreme. It is not possible to measure the length and breadth of Kṛṣṇa by one's minuscule knowledge, and one who arrives at this conclusion is considered intelligent by Vedic literature. One should come to understand, submissively, that he is a very insignificant segment of the universe. Abandoning the endeavor to understand the Supreme by limited knowledge or mental speculation, we should become submissive and hear of the Supreme through the authoritative sources such as Bhagavad-gītā or through the lips of a realized soul.  In Bhagavad-gītā Arjuna is hearing about God from the lips of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. In this way Arjuna set the criterion for understanding the Supreme by submissive hearing. It is our position to hear Bhagavad-gītā from the lips of Arjuna or his bona fide representative, the spiritual master. After hearing, it is necessary to practice this acquired knowledge in daily life. \"My dear Lord, You are unconquerable,\" the devotee prays, \"but by this process, by hearing, You are conquered.\" God is unconquerable, but He is conquered by the devotee who abandons mental speculation and listens to authoritative sources."

By the ascending process one is elevated by knowledge acquired by himself. In this way one thinks, \"I don't care for any authorities or books. I will attain knowledge myself by meditation, philosophy, etc. In this way I will understand God.\" The other process, the descending process, involves receiving knowledge from higher authorities. Brahma-saṁhitā states that if one takes to the ascending process and travels at the speed of mind and wind for millions of years, he will still end up not knowing. For him, the subject matter will remain elusive and inconceivable. But that subject matter is given in Bhagavad-gītā: ananya-cetāḥ. Kṛṣṇa says to meditate on Him without deviation from the path of devotional service in submission. For one who worships Him in this way—tasyāhaṁ sulabhaḥ: \"I become easily available.\" This is the process: if one works for Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day, Kṛṣṇa cannot forget him. By becoming submissive, he can attract the attention of God. As Guru Mahārāja Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī used to say, \"Don't try to see God. Is God to come and stand before us like a servant just because we want to see Him? That is not the submissive way. We have to oblige Him by our love and service.\"  The proper process for approaching Kṛṣṇa was given to humanity by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and Rūpa Gosvāmī, His first disciple, appreciated it. Rūpa Gosvāmī was a minister in the Muhammadan government, but he left the government to become a disciple of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When he first went to see the Lord, Rūpa Gosvāmī approached Him with the following verse:  namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya- nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ [Cc. Madhya 19.53]  Rūpa Gosvāmī called Caitanya Mahāprabhu \"the most munificent, the most charitable personality,\" because He was offering the most precious thing of all very cheaply—love of God. We all want Kṛṣṇa and are all hankering after Him. Kṛṣṇa is the most attractive, the most beautiful, the most opulent, the most powerful, and the most learned. That is the object of our hankering. We're hankering after the beautiful, the powerful, the learned, the wealthy. Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all of this, so we need only turn our attention toward Him, and we will get everything. Everything—whatever we want. Whatever is our heart's desire will be fulfilled by this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

How then can we make it comfortable? Is it possible to make this world comfortable by the so-called advancement of science? No, this is not possible. As a result, we do not even wish to know what these miseries are. The miseries, as stated before, are birth, old age, disease, and death, and because we cannot make a solution to them, we try to set them aside. Science has no power to solve these miseries that are always giving us trouble. Instead, they divert our attention to the making of spaceships or atomic bombs. The solution to these problems is given here in Bhagavad-gītā: if one attains to Kṛṣṇa's platform he does not have to return again to this earth of birth and death. We should try to understand that this place is full of miseries. It takes a certain amount of developed consciousness to understand this. Cats and dogs and hogs cannot understand that they are suffering. Man is called a rational animal, but his rationality is being used to further his animalistic propensities instead of to find out how to get liberation from this miserable condition. Here Kṛṣṇa explicitly states that one who comes to Him will never be reborn to suffer miseries again. Those great souls who come to Him have attained the highest perfection of life, which alleviates the living entity from the suffering of conditional existence.  One of the differences between Kṛṣṇa and an ordinary being is that an ordinary entity can be in only one place at a time, but Kṛṣṇa can be everywhere in the universe and yet also in His own abode, simultaneously. Kṛṣṇa's abode in the transcendental kingdom is called Goloka Vṛndāvana. The Vṛndāvana in India is that same Vṛndāvana descended on this earth. When Kṛṣṇa descends Himself by His own internal potency, His dhāma, or abode, also descends. In other words, when Kṛṣṇa descends on this earth, He manifests Himself in that particular land. Despite this, Kṛṣṇa's abode remains eternally in the transcendental sphere, in the Vaikuṇṭhas. In this verse Kṛṣṇa proclaims that one who comes to His abode in the Vaikuṇṭhas never has to take birth again in the material world. Such a person is called a mahātmā. The word mahātmā is generally heard in the West in connection with Mahatma Gandhi, but we should understand that mahātmā is not the title of a politician. Rather, mahātmā refers to the first-class Kṛṣṇa conscious man who is eligible to enter into the abode of Kṛṣṇa. The mahātmā's perfection is this: to utilize the human form of life and the resources of nature to extricate himself from the cycle of birth and death."

As stated before, we are always in a miserable condition due to this mind, body, natural disturbances, or other living entities. There is always some kind of misery inflicted upon us. This material world is meant for misery; unless the misery is there, we cannot come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Miseries are actually an impetus and help to elevate us to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. An intelligent man questions why these miseries are inflicted on him by force. However, modern civilization's attitude is, \"Let me suffer. Let me cover it by some intoxication, that's all.\" But as soon as the intoxication is over, the miseries return. It is not possible to make a solution to the miseries of life by artificial intoxication. The solution is made by Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  One may point out that although the devotees of Kṛṣṇa are trying to enter Kṛṣṇa's planet, everyone else is interested in going to the moon. Isn't going to the moon also perfection? The tendency to travel to other planets is always present in the living entity. One name for the living entity is sarva-gata, which means \"one who wants to travel everywhere.\" Travel is part of the nature of the living entity. The desire to go to the moon is not a new thing. The yogīs also are interested in entering the higher planets, but in Bhagavad-gītā (8.16) Kṛṣṇa points out that this will not be of any help."

The earth is considered to be a member of the middle planetary system. Kṛṣṇa points out that even if one enters into the highest planet of all, called Brahmaloka, there is still repetition of birth and death. Other planets in the universe are full of living entities. We should not think that we are here and that all the other planets are vacant. From experience we can see that no place on earth is vacant of living entities. If we dig deep down into the earth, we find worms; if we go deep into the water, we find aquatics; if we go into the sky, we find so many birds. How is it possible to conclude that other planets have no living entities? But Kṛṣṇa points out that even if we enter into those planets where great demigods reside, we will still be subjected to death. Again, Kṛṣṇa repeats that upon reaching His planet, one need not take birth again.  We should be very serious about attaining our eternal life full of bliss and knowledge. We have forgotten that this is actually our aim of life, our real self-interest. Why have we forgotten? We have simply been entrapped by the material glitter, by skyscrapers, big factories, and political play, although we know that however big we build skyscrapers, we will not be able to live here indefinitely. We should not spoil our energy in building mighty industries and cities to further entrap ourselves in material nature; rather, our energy should be used to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in order to attain a spiritual body whereby we may enter into Kṛṣṇa's planet. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a religious formula or some spiritual recreation; it is the most important part of the living entity."

Although they may have many mystic powers, these yogīs still have the tendency to want to enjoy the facilities of material life. On the higher planets, it is possible to live for incredibly long lifetimes. The time calculation on these planets is indicated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa:  sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ rātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te 'ho-rātra-vido janāḥ  One yuga covers 4,300,000 years. This number multiplied by one thousand is calculated to be twelve hours of Brahmā on the planet Brahmaloka. Similarly, another twelve-hour period covers the night. Thirty such days equal a month, twelve months a year, and Brahmā lives for one hundred such years. Life on such a planet is indeed long, yet even after trillions of years, the inhabitants of Brahmaloka have to face death. Unless we go to the spiritual planets, there is no escape from death.  avyaktād vyaktayaḥ sarvāḥ prabhavanty ahar-āgame rātry-āgame pralīyante tatraivāvyakta-saṁjñake  At the end of the day of Brahmā, all the lower planetary systems are covered with water, and the beings on them are annihilated.

There all the planets are eternal, and the lives of all the beings on them are eternal. In this verse the word bhāvaḥ means \"nature,\" and here another nature is indicated. In this world we have experience also of two natures. The living entity is spirit, and as long as he is within matter, matter is moving, and as soon as the living entity, the spiritual spark, is out of the body, the body is immovable. The spiritual nature is called Kṛṣṇa's superior nature, and the material is called the inferior. Beyond this material nature there is a superior nature, which is totally spiritual. It is not possible to understand this by experimental knowledge. We can see millions and millions of stars through a telescope, but we cannot approach them. We have to understand our incapabilities. If we cannot understand the material universe by experimental knowledge, what is the possibility of understanding God and His kingdom? It is not possible experimentally. We have to understand by hearing Bhagavad-gītā. We cannot understand who our father is by experimental knowledge; we have to hear the word of our mother and believe her. If we do not believe her, there is no way of knowing. Similarly, if we just stick to the Kṛṣṇa conscious method, all information about Kṛṣṇa and His kingdom will be revealed."

      "text" : "Paras tu bhāvaḥ means \"superior nature,\" and vyaktaḥ refers to what we see manifested. We can see that the material universe is manifested through the earth, sun, stars, and planets. And beyond this universe is another nature, an eternal nature. Avyaktāt sanātanaḥ. This material nature has a beginning and an end, but that spiritual nature is sanātanaḥ—eternal. It has neither beginning nor end. How is this possible? A cloud may pass over the sky, and it may appear to cover a great distance, but actually it is only a small speck covering an insignificant part of the whole sky. Because we are so small, if only a few hundred miles is covered by cloud, it appears that the whole sky is covered. Similarly, this whole material universe is like a small, insignificant cloud in the vast spiritual sky. It is encased by the mahat-tattva, matter. As a cloud has a beginning and an end, this material nature also has a beginning and an end. When the clouds disappear and the sky clears, we see everything as it is. Similarly, the body is like a cloud passing over the spirit soul. It stays for some time, gives some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. Any kind of material phenomenon that we observe is subject to these six transformations of material nature—it comes into being, grows, stays for a while, produces some by-products, dwindles, and then vanishes. Kṛṣṇa indicates that beyond this changing, cloudlike nature there is a spiritual nature, which is eternal. In addition, when this material nature is annihilated, that avyaktāt sanātanaḥ will remain.  In Vedic literatures there is a good deal of information about the material and spiritual skies. In the Second Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam there are descriptions of the spiritual sky and of its inhabitants. There is even information given that there are spiritual airplanes in the spiritual sky and that the liberated entities there travel about on these planes like lightning. Everything that we find here can also be found there in reality. Here in the material sky everything is an imitation, or shadow, of that which exists in the spiritual sky. As in a cinema we simply see a show or facsimile of the real thing, in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is said that this material world is but a combination of matter modeled after the reality, just as a mannequin of a girl in a store window is modeled after a girl. Every sane man knows that the mannequin is an imitation. Śrīdhara Svāmī says that because the spiritual world is real, this material world, which is an imitation, appears to be real. We must understand the meaning of reality—reality means existence which cannot be vanquished; reality means eternity."

Those who can see things as they are do not take part in shadow pleasure. The real aim of human life is to attain to the spiritual sky, but as Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam points out, most people do not know about it. Human life is meant to understand reality and to be transferred into it. All Vedic literature instructs us not to remain in this darkness. The nature of this material world is darkness, but the spiritual world is full of light and yet is not illumined by fire or electricity. Kṛṣṇa hints of this in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā (15.6):  na tad bhāsayate sūryo na śaśāṅko na pāvakaḥ yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama  The spiritual world is called unmanifested because it cannot be perceived by material senses.  avyakto 'kṣara ity uktas tam āhuḥ paramāṁ gatim yaṁ prāpya na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama"

Paramāṁ gatim—that journey is supreme. There is no question of going a few thousand miles away from this planet and then returning. This sort of journey is not very heroic. We have to penetrate the whole material universe. This we cannot do by spaceships but by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who is absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and who at the time of death thinks of Kṛṣṇa is at once transferred there. If we at all want to go to that spiritual sky and cultivate eternal, blissful life, full of knowledge, we will have to begin now to cultivate a sac-cid-ānanda body. It is said that Kṛṣṇa has a sac-cid-ānanda body—īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. 5.1]—and we also have a similar body of eternity, knowledge, and bliss, but it is very small and is covered by the dress of matter. If somehow or other we are able to give up this false dress, we can reach that spiritual kingdom. If once we can attain that spiritual world, return is not necessary (yaṁ prāpya na nivartante).  Everyone, then, should try to go to that dhāma paramam—Kṛṣṇa's supreme abode. Kṛṣṇa Himself comes to call us, and He gives us literatures as guidebooks and sends His bona fide representatives. We should take advantage of this facility given to human life. For one who reaches that supreme abode, penances, austerities, yogic meditations, and so on are no longer required, and for one who does not reach it, all penances and austerities are a useless waste of time. The human form of life is an opportunity to get this boon, and it is the duty of the state, parents, teachers, and guardians to elevate those who have acquired this human form of life to attain this perfection of life. Simply eating, sleeping, mating, and quarreling like cats and dogs is not civilization. We should properly utilize this human form of life and take advantage of this knowledge to prepare ourselves in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so that twenty-four hours of the day we will be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa and at death at once transfer to that spiritual sky."

Bhaktyā means devotional service, submission to the Supreme Lord. The root word for bhaktyā is bhaj, which means \"service.\" The definition of bhakti given in the Nārada Pañcarātra is \"freedom from designation.\" If one is determined to get out of all the designations that are attached to the pure spirit soul, and which arise due to the body and are always changed when the body is changed, one can attain to bhakti. Bhakti is realizing that one is pure spirit and not matter at all. Our real identity is not this body, which is simply a covering of the spirit, but our real identity is dāsa, servant of Kṛṣṇa. When one is situated in his real identity and is rendering service to Kṛṣṇa, he is a bhakta. Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam: [Cc. Madhya 19.170] when our senses are free from material designations, we will utilize them in the service of the master of the senses, Hṛṣīkeśa, or Kṛṣṇa.  As Rūpa Gosvāmī points out, we have to serve Kṛṣṇa favorably. Generally we want to serve God for some material purpose or gain. Of course, one who goes to God for material gain is better than one who never goes, but we should be free from desire for material benefit. Our aim should be to understand Kṛṣṇa. Of course Kṛṣṇa is unlimited, and it is not possible to understand Him, but we have to accept what we can understand. Bhagavad-gītā is specifically presented for our understanding. Through receiving knowledge in this way, we should know that Kṛṣṇa is pleased, and we should serve Him favorably, according to His pleasure. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a great science with immense literatures, and we should utilize them for the attainment of bhakti.  Puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ: in the spiritual sky, the Supreme Lord is present as the Supreme Person. There are innumerable self-luminous planets there, and in each one an expansion of Kṛṣṇa resides. They are four-armed and have innumerable names. They are all persons—they are not impersonal. These puruṣas, or persons, can be approached by bhakti, not by challenge, philosophical speculation, or mental concoctions, nor by physical exercises, but by devotion without the deviations of fruitive activity."

How is that? He is just like the sun, which is situated in one place and yet is present all over by its rays. Although God is situated in His dhāma paramam, His energies are distributed everywhere. Nor is He different from His energies, inasmuch as the sunshine and the sun are nondifferent. Since Kṛṣṇa and His energies are nondifferent, we can see Kṛṣṇa everywhere if we are advanced in devotional service.  premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti  Those who are filled with love of God see God constantly before them. It is not that we saw God last night and He is no longer present. No. For one who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, Kṛṣṇa is always present and can be perceived constantly. We simply have to develop the eyes to see Him.  Due to our material bondage, the covering of the material senses, we cannot understand what is spiritual. But this ignorance can be removed by this process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. How is this? A sleeping man may be awakened by sound vibration. Although a man may be for all intents and purposes unconscious—he cannot see, feel, smell, etc.—the sense of hearing is so prominent that a sleeping man may be awakened just by sound vibration. Similarly, the spirit soul, although now overpowered by the sleep of material contact, can be revived by this transcendental sound vibration of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Hare Kṛṣṇa is simply an address to the Supreme Lord and His energies. Hare means energy, and Kṛṣṇa is the name of the Supreme Lord, so when we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa we are saying, \"O energy of the Lord, O Lord, please accept me.\" We have no other prayer for acceptance by the Lord. There is no question of praying for daily bread, for the bread is always there. Hare Kṛṣṇa is but an address to the Supreme Lord, requesting Him to accept us. "

Antya 20.32, Śikṣāṣṭaka 5]  The only hope for a man fallen in the middle of the ocean is that someone will come and pick him up. If someone just comes and hauls him but a few feet out of the water, he is immediately relieved. Similarly, if we are somehow lifted from the ocean of birth and death by the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we are immediately relieved.  Although we cannot perceive the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, His name, fame, and activities, if we establish ourselves in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, gradually God will reveal Himself before us. We cannot see God by our own endeavor, but if we qualify ourselves, God will reveal Himself, and then we will see. No one can order God to come before him and dance, but we do have to work in such a way that Kṛṣṇa will be pleased to reveal Himself to us.  Kṛṣṇa gives us information about Himself in Bhagavad-gītā, and there is no question of doubting it; we just have to feel it, understand it. There is no preliminary qualification necessary for the understanding of Bhagavad-gītā, because it is spoken from the absolute platform. The simple process of chanting the names of Kṛṣṇa will reveal what one is, what God is, what the material and spiritual universes are, why we are conditioned, how we can get out of that conditioning—and everything else, step by step. Actually, the process of belief and revelation is not foreign to us. Every day we place faith in something that we have confidence will be revealed later. We may purchase a ticket to go to India, and on the basis of the ticket we have faith that we will be transported there. Why should we pay money for a ticket? We do not just give the money to anyone. The company is authorized and the airline is authorized, so faith is created. Without faith we cannot take one step forward in the ordinary course of our life. Faith we must have, but it must be faith in that which is authorized. It is not that we have blind faith, but that we accept something that is recognized. "

      "text" : "Bhagavad-gītā is recognized and accepted as scripture by all classes of men in India, and as far as outside India is concerned, many scholars, theologians, and philosophers accept Bhagavad-gītā as a great, authoritative work. There is no question that Bhagavad-gītā is authority. Even Professor Albert Einstein, such a scientist, read Bhagavad-gītā regularly.  From Bhagavad-gītā we have to accept that there is a spiritual universe which is the kingdom of God. If somehow we are transported to a country where we are informed that we will no longer have to undergo birth, old age, disease, and death, will we not be happy? If we heard of such a place, surely we would try as hard as possible to go there. No one wants to grow old; no one wants to die. Indeed, a place free of such sufferings would be our heart's desire. Why do we want this? Because we have the right, the prerogative, to want it. We are eternal, blissful, and full of knowledge, but having been covered by this material entanglement, we have forgotten ourselves. Therefore Bhagavad-gītā gives us the advantage of being able to revive our original status.  The Śaṅkarites and Buddhists claim that the world beyond is void, but Bhagavad-gītā does not disappoint us like this. The philosophy of voidness has simply created atheists. We are spiritual beings, and we want enjoyment, but as soon as our future is void, we will become inclined to enjoy this material life. In this way, the impersonalists discuss the philosophy of voidism while trying as much as possible to enjoy this material life. One may enjoy speculation in this way, but there is no spiritual benefit.  brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām  He who has progressed in devotional life and who is relishing service to Kṛṣṇa will automatically become detached from material enjoyment.

      "text" : "If one gets something superior, he naturally gives up all inferior things. We want enjoyment, but impersonalism and voidism have created such an atmosphere that we have become addicted to material enjoyment. There must be enjoyment in connection with the Supreme Person (puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ), whom we can see face to face. In the spiritual sky we are able to speak personally with God, play with Him, eat with Him, etc. All of this can be attained by bhaktyā—transcendental loving service. However, this service must be without adulteration, that is to say, we must love God without expecting material remuneration. Loving God to become one with Him is also a form of adulteration.  One of the major differences between the spiritual sky and the material sky is that in the spiritual sky the head or leader of the spiritual planets has no rival. In all cases, the predominating personality in the spiritual planets is a plenary expansion of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The Supreme Lord and His multifarious manifestations preside over all the Vaikuṇṭha planets. On earth, for instance, there is rivalry for the position of president or prime minister, but in the spiritual sky everyone acknowledges the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be supreme. Those who do not acknowledge Him and attempt to rival Him are placed into the material universe, which is just like a prison house. As in any city there is a prison, and the prison forms a very insignificant part of the whole city, so the material universe is a prison for the conditioned souls. It forms an insignificant part of the spiritual sky, but it is not outside the spiritual sky, just as a prison is not outside of the city.  The inhabitants of the Vaikuṇṭha planets in the spiritual sky are all liberated souls. In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam we are informed that their bodily features are exactly like God's. On some of these planets God is manifested with two arms, and on others He has four. The inhabitants of these planets, like the Supreme Lord, also manifest two and four arms, and it is said that one cannot distinguish between them and the Supreme Person. In the spiritual world there are five kinds of liberation. Sāyujya-mukti is a form of liberation in which one merges into the impersonal existence of the Supreme Lord, called Brahman. Another form of liberation is sārūpya-mukti, by which one receives features exactly like God's. Another is sālokya-mukti, by which one can live in the same planet with God. "

      "text" : "By sārṣṭi-mukti one can have opulences similar to the Supreme Lord's. Another type enables one to remain always with God as one of His associates, just like Arjuna, who is always with Kṛṣṇa as His friend. One can have any of these five forms of liberation, but of the five the sāyujya-mukti, merging with the impersonal aspect, is not accepted by Vaiṣṇava devotees. A Vaiṣṇava wishes to worship God as He is and retain his separate individuality to serve Him, whereas the Māyāvādī impersonal philosopher wishes to lose his individuality and merge into the existence of the Supreme. This merging is recommended neither by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad-gītā nor by the disciplic succession of Vaiṣṇava philosophers. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu wrote on this subject in His Śikṣāṣṭaka (4):  na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi [Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]  Here Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu refers to \"birth after birth.\" When there is birth after birth, there is no liberation. In liberation one either attains the spiritual planets or merges into the existence of the Supreme—in either case, there is no question of rebirth into the material world. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu doesn't care whether He is liberated or not: His only concern is to be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to serve the Supreme Lord. The devotee doesn't care where he is, nor does he care whether he is born in the animal society, human society, demigod society, or whatever—he only prays to God that he not forget Him and that he always be able to engage in His transcendental service. These are symptoms of pure devotion. Of course a devotee, wherever he is, remains in the spiritual kingdom, even while in this material body. But he does not demand anything from God for his own personal elevation or comfort."

      "text" : "Materialistic science may one day finally discover the eternal anti-material world which has for so long been unknown to the wranglers of gross materialism. Regarding the scientists' present conception of antimatter, the Times of India (Oct. 27, 1959) published the following news release:  Stockholm, Oct. 26, 1959-Two American atomic scientists were awarded the 1959 Nobel Physics Prize today for the discovery of the antiproton, proving that matter exists in two forms—as particles and antiparticles. They are Italian—born Dr. Emillo Segre, 69, and Dr. Owen Chamberlain, born in San Francisco.... According to one of the fundamental assumptions of the new theory, there may exist another world, or an anti-world, built up of antimatter. This anti-material world would consist of atomic and subatomic particles spinning in reverse orbits to those of the world we know. If these two worlds should ever clash, they would both be annihilated in one blinding flash.  In this statement, the following propositions are put forward:  1. There is an anti-material atom or particle which is made up of the anti-qualities of material atoms.  2. There is another world besides this material world of which we have only limited experience.  3. The anti-material and material worlds may clash at a certain period and may annihilate one another.  Out of these three items, we, the students of theistic science, can fully agree with items 1 and 2, but we can agree with item 3 only within the limited scientific definition of antimatter. The difficulty lies in the fact that the scientists' conception of antimatter extends only to another variety of material energy, whereas the real antimatter must be entirely anti-material. Matter as it is constituted is subjected to annihilation, but antimatter—if it is to be free from all material symptoms—must also be free from annihilation, by its very nature. If matter is destructible or separable, antimatter must be indestructible and inseparable. We shall try to discuss these propositions from the angle of authentic scriptural vision."

      "text" : "The most widely recognized scriptures in the world are the Vedas. The Vedas have been divided into four parts: Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg and Atharva. The subject matter of the Vedas is very difficult for a man of ordinary understanding. For elucidation, the four Vedas are explained in the historical epic called the Mahābhārata and in eighteen Purāṇas. The Rāmāyaṇa is also a historical epic which contains all the necessary information from the Vedas. So the four Vedas, the original Rāmāyaṇa by Vālmīki, the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas are classified as Vedic literatures. The Upaniṣads are parts of the four Vedas, and the Vedānta-sūtras represent the cream of the Vedas. To summarize all these Vedic literatures, the Bhagavad-gītā is accepted as the essence of all Upaniṣads and the preliminary explanation of the Vedānta-sūtras. One may then conclude that from the Bhagavad-gītā alone one can have the essence of the Vedas, for it is spoken by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who descends upon this material world from the anti-material world in order to give complete information of the superior form of energy.  The superior form of energy of the Personality of Godhead is described in the Bhagavad-gītā as parā prakṛti. The scientists have recently discovered that there are two forms of perishable matter, but the Bhagavad-gītā describes most perfectly the concept of matter and antimatter in terms of two forms of energy. Matter is an energy which creates the material world, and the same energy, in its superior form, also creates the anti-material (transcendental) world. The living entities belong to the category of superior energy. The inferior energy, or material energy, is called aparā prakṛti. In the Bhagavad-gītā the creative energy is thus presented in two forms, namely aparā and parā prakṛti."
    }, {
      "text" : "Matter itself has no creative power. When it is manipulated by the living energy, material things are produced. Matter in its crude form is therefore the latent energy of the Supreme Being. Whenever we think of energy, it is natural that we think of the source of energy. For example, when we think of electrical energy, we simultaneously think of the powerhouse where it is generated. Energy is not self-sufficient. It is under the control of a superior living being. For example, fire is the source of two other energies, namely light and heat. Light and heat have no independent existence outside of fire. Similarly, the inferior and superior energies are derived from a source, which one may call by any name. That source of energy must be a living being with full sense of everything. That supreme living being is the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or the all-attractive living being.  In the Vedas the supreme living being, or the Absolute Truth, is called Bhagavān—the opulent one, the living being who is the fountainhead of all energies. The discovery of the two forms of limited energies by the modern scientists is just the beginning of the progress of science. Now they must go further to discover the source of the two particles or atoms which they term material and anti-material.  How can the anti-material particle be explained? We have experience with material particles or atoms, but we have no experience with anti-material atoms. However, the Bhagavad-gītā gives the following vivid description of the anti-material particle:  This anti-material particle is within the material body. Because of the presence of this anti-material particle, the material body is progressively changing from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youth to old age, after which the anti-material particle leaves the old, unworkable body and takes up another material body."
    }, {
      "text" : "This description of a living body confirms the scientific discovery that energy exists in two forms. When one of them, the anti-material particle, is separated from the material body, the latter becomes useless for all purposes. As such, the anti-material particle is undoubtedly superior to the material energy.  No one, therefore, should lament for the loss of material energy. All varieties of sense perception in the categories of heat and cold, happiness and distress, are but interactions of material energy which come and go like seasonal changes. The temporary appearance and disappearance of such material interactions confirms that the material body is formed of a material energy inferior to the living force, or jīva energy.  Any intelligent man who is not disturbed by happiness and distress, understanding that they are different material phases resulting from the interactions of the inferior energy, is competent to regain the anti-material world, where life is eternal, full of permanent knowledge and bliss.  The anti-material world is mentioned here, and in addition information is given that in the anti-material world there is no \"seasonal\" fluctuation. Everything there is permanent, blissful, and full of knowledge. But when we speak of it as a \"world,\" we must remember that it has forms and paraphernalia of various categories beyond our material experiences.  The material body is destructible, and as such it is changeable and temporary. So is the material world. But the anti-material living force is nondestructible, and therefore it is permanent. Expert scientists have thus distinguished the different qualities of the material and anti-material particles as temporary and permanent respectively."
    }, {
      "text" : "The discoverers of the two forms of matter have yet to find out the qualities of antimatter. But a vivid description is already given in the Bhagavad-gītā as follows. The scientist can make further research on the basis of this valuable information.  The anti-material particle is finer than the finest of material particles. This living force is so powerful that it spreads its influence all over the material body. The anti-material particle has immense potency in comparison to the material particle, and consequently it cannot be destroyed.  This is but the beginning of the description of the anti-material particle in the Bhagavad-gītā. It is further explained as follows:  The finest form of the anti-material particle is encaged within the gross and subtle material bodies. Although the material bodies (both gross and subtle) are subject to destruction, the finer, anti-material particle is eternal. One's interest, therefore, should be in this eternal principle.  The perfection of science will occur when it is possible for the material scientists to know the qualities of the anti-material particle and liberate it from the association of nonpermanent, material particles. Such liberation would mark the culmination of scientific progress.  There is partial truth in the scientists' suggestion that there may exist also another world consisting of anti-material atoms and that a clash between the material and anti-material worlds will result in the annihilation of both. There is a clash which is continually going on: the annihilation of the material particles is taking place at every moment, and the nonmaterial particle is striving for liberation. This is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā as follows:"
    }, {
      "text" : "The nonmaterial particle, which is the living entity, influences the material particle to work. This living entity is always indestructible. As long as the nonmaterial particle is within the lump of material energy—known by the names of gross and subtle bodies—then the entity is manifest as a living unit. In the continuous clashing between the two particles, the nonmaterial particle is never annihilated. No one can destroy the anti-material particle at any time—past, present or future.  Therefore, we think that the theory maintaining that the material and anti-material worlds may clash, resulting in the annihilation of both worlds, is correct only within the context of the scientists' limited definition of antimatter. The Bhagavad-gītā explains the nature of the anti-material particle, which can never be annihilated:  The fine and immeasurable anti-material particle is always indestructible, permanent and eternal. After a certain period, however, its encagement by material particles is annihilated. This same principle also operates in the case of the material and anti-material worlds. No one should fear the annihilation of the anti-material particle, for it survives the annihilation of material worlds.  Everything that is created is annihilated at a certain stage. Both the material body and the material world are created, and they are therefore subject to annihilation. The anti-material particle, however, is never created, and consequently it is never annihilated. This also is corroborated in the Bhagavad-gītā:"
    }, {
      "text" : "The anti-material particle, which is the vital force, is never born or created. It exists eternally. It has neither birth dates nor death dates. It is neither repeatedly created nor repeatedly destroyed. It is eternally existing, and therefore it is the oldest of the old, and yet it is always fresh and new. Although the material particle is annihilated, the anti-material particle is never affected.  The principle is also applicable to the anti-material universe as well as to the anti-material particle. When the material universe is annihilated, the anti-material universe exists in all circumstances. This will be explained in more detail later.  The scientist may also learn the following from the Bhagavad-gītā:  The learned man who knows perfectly well that the anti-material particle is indestructible knows that it cannot be annihilated by any means.  The atomic scientist may consider annihilating the material world by nuclear weapons, but his weapons cannot destroy the anti-material world. The anti-material particle is more clearly explained in the following lines:  It is neither cut into pieces by any material weapon, nor is it burnt by fire. Nor is it moistened by water, nor withered, nor dried up, nor evaporated in the air. It is indivisible, nonflammable and insoluble. Because it is eternal, it can enter into and leave any sort of body. Being steady by constitution, its qualities are always fixed. It is inexplicable, because it is contrary to all material qualities. It is unthinkable by the ordinary brain. It is unchangeable. No one, therefore, should ever lament for what is an eternal, anti-material principle."
    }, {
      "text" : "Thus, in the Bhagavad-gītā and in all other Vedic literatures the superior energy (anti-material principle) is accepted as the vital force, or the living spirit. This is also called the jīva. This living principle cannot be generated by any combination of material elements. There are eight material principles which are described as inferior energies, and they are: (1) earth, (2) water, (3) fire, (4) air, (5) ether, (6) mind, (7) intelligence and (8) ego. Apart from these is the living force, or the anti-material principle, which is described as the superior energy. These are called \"energies\" because they are wielded and controlled by the supreme living being, the Personality of Godhead (Kṛṣṇa).  For a long time the materialist was limited within the boundary of the eight material principles mentioned above. Now it is encouraging to see that he has a little preliminary information of the anti-material principle and the anti-material universe. We hope that with the progress of time the materialist will be able to estimate the value of the anti-material world, in which there is no trace of material principles. Of course the very word \"anti-material\" indicates that the principle is in opposition to all material qualities.  There are, of course, the mental speculators who comment upon the anti-material principle. These fall into two main groups, and they arrive at two different erroneous conclusions. One group (the gross materialists) either denies the anti-material principle or admits only the disintegration of material combination at a certain stage (death). The other group accepts the anti-material principle as being in direct opposition to the material principle with its twenty-four categories. This group is known as the Sāṅkhyaites, and they investigate the material principles and analyze them minutely. At the end of their investigation, the Sāṅkhyaites finally accept only a transcendental (anti-material) nonactive principle. However, difficulties arise for all these mental speculators because they speculate with the help of inferior energy. They do not accept information from the superior. In order to realize the real position of the anti-material principle, one must rise to the transcendental plane of superior energy. Bhakti-yoga is the very activity of superior energy."
    }, {
      "text" : "From the platform of the material world, one cannot estimate the real position of the anti-material world. But the Supreme Lord, who is the controller of both material and anti-material energies, descends out of His causeless mercy and gives us complete information of the anti-material world. In this way we can know what the anti-material world is. The Supreme Lord and the living entities are both anti-material in quality, we are informed. Thus, we can have an idea of the Supreme Lord by an elaborate study of the living entities. Every living entity is an individual person. Therefore, the supreme living being must also be the supreme person. In the Vedic literatures the supreme person is properly claimed to be Kṛṣṇa. The name \"Kṛṣṇa,\" indicating the Supreme Lord, is the only truly intelligible name of the highest order. He is the controller of both material and anti-material energies, and the very word \"Kṛṣṇa\" signifies that He is the supreme controller. In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord confirms this as follows:  There are two worlds—the material and anti-material. The material world is composed of inferior qualitative energy divided into eight material principles. The anti-material world is made of superior qualitative energy. Because both the material and anti-material energies are emanations of the Supreme Transcendence, the Personality of Godhead, it is proper to conclude that I [Lord Kṛṣṇa] am the ultimate cause of all creations and annihilations.  Because the Lord's two energies (inferior and superior) manifest the material and anti-material worlds, He is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. Lord Kṛṣṇa explains this in the Bhagavad-gītā thus:  I am, Arjuna, the highest principle of transcendence, and there is nothing greater than Me. Everything that be rests on My energies exactly like pearls on a thread."
    }, {
      "text" : "Long, long before the discovery of the principles of antimatter and the anti-material worlds, the subject was delineated in the pages of Bhagavad-gītā. The Gītā itself indicates that its philosophy had previously been taught to the presiding deity of the sun, which implies that the principles of the Bhagavad-gītā were expounded by the Personality of Godhead long before the Battle of Kurukṣetra—at least some 120,000,000 years before. Now modern science has just discovered a fraction of the truths that are available in the Bhagavad-gītā.  The assumption of an anti-material universe is also found in the Bhagavad-gītā. And from all data available it is to be assumed without the slightest doubt that the anti-material world is situated in the anti-material sky, a sky which is mentioned in the Bhagavad-gītā as sanātana-dhāma, or the eternal nature.  Exactly as material atoms create the material world, the anti-material atoms create the anti-material world with all its paraphernalia. The anti-material world is inhabited by anti-material living beings. In the anti-material world there is no inert matter. Everything there is a living principle, and the Supreme Personality in that region is God Himself. The denizens of the anti-material world possess eternal life, eternal knowledge and eternal bliss. In other words, they have all the qualifications of God.  In the material world the topmost planet is called Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka. Beings of the greatest talents live on this planet. The presiding deity of Brahmaloka is Brahmā, the first created being of this material world. Brahmā is a living being like so many of us, but he is the most talented personality in the material world. He is not so talented that he is in the category of God, but he is in the category of those living entities directly dominated by God. God and the living entities both belong to the anti-material world. The scientist, therefore, would be rendering service to everyone by researching the constitution of the anti-material world—how it is administered, how things are shaped there, who are the presiding personalities, and so on. Of the Vedic literatures, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam deals elaborately with these matters. The Bhagavad-gītā is the preliminary study of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. These two important books of knowledge should be thoroughly studied by all men in the scientific world. These books would give many clues to scientific progress and would indicate many new discoveries."
    }, {
      "text" : "The transcendentalists and the materialists are two distinct classes of men. The transcendentalist gathers knowledge from authoritative scriptures like the Vedas. Vedic literature is received from authoritative sources which are in the line of transcendental disciplic succession. This disciplic succession (paramparā) is also mentioned in the Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā that hundreds of thousands of years ago the Gītā was spoken to the presiding deity of the sun, who delivered the knowledge to his son Manu, from whom the present generation of man has descended. Manu, in his turn, delivered this transcendental knowledge to his son King Ikṣvāku, who is the forefather of the dynasty in which the Personality of Godhead Śrī Rāma appeared. This long chain of disciplic succession was broken during the advent period of Lord Kṛṣṇa (five thousand years ago), and for this reason Kṛṣṇa restated the Bhagavad-gītā to Arjuna, thereby making him the first disciple of this knowledge in this age. The transcendentalist of this age, therefore, is in the disciplic line that starts with Arjuna. Without troubling himself with materialistic research work, the transcendentalist acquires the truths concerning matter and antimatter in the most perfect way (through this disciplic succession) and thereby saves himself much botheration.  The gross materialists, however, do not believe in the anti-material worlds of the Personality of Godhead. They are therefore unfortunate creatures, although sometimes very talented, educated and advanced otherwise. They are bewildered by the influence of the material manifestation and are devoid of knowledge of things anti-material. It is a good sign, therefore, that the materialistic scientists are gradually progressing toward the region of the anti-material world. It may even be possible for them to make sufficient progress to be able to know the details of this anti-material world, where the Personality of Godhead resides as the predominating figure and where the living entities live with Him and serve Him. The living entities who serve the Godhead are equal in quality to Him, but at the same time they are predominated as servitors. In the anti-material world there is no difference between the predominated and the predominator—the relationship is in perfection and without tinge of materialism."
    }, {
      "text" : "The nature of the material world is destructive. According to the Bhagavad-gītā, there is some partial truth to the assumption of the physical scientist that there is annihilation of the material and anti-material worlds when they chance to clash. The material world is a creation of changing modes of nature. These modes (guṇas) are known as sattva (goodness), rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance). The material world is created by the mode of rajas, maintained by the mode of sattva, and annihilated by the mode of tamas. These modes are omnipresent in the material world, and as such, at every hour, every minute, every second, the process of creation, maintenance and annihilation is taking place all over the material universe. The highest planet of the material universe, Brahmaloka, is also subjected to these modes of nature, although the duration of life on that planet, due to the predominance of the mode of sattva, is said to be 4,300,000 x 1,000 x 2 x 30 x 12 x 100 solar years. Despite this long duration, however, Brahmaloka is subject to destruction. Although life on Brahmaloka is fantastically long compared to life on Earth, it is only a flash in comparison to the eternal life of the nonmaterial worlds. Consequently, the speaker of the Bhagavad-gītā, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, asserts the importance of the anti-material universe, which is His abode.  Lord Kṛṣṇa instructs that all the planets within the material universe are destroyed at the end of 4,300,000 x 1,000 x 2 x 30 x 12 x 100 solar years. And all the living beings inhabiting these material planets are destroyed materially along with the destruction of the material worlds. The living entity, however, is constitutionally an anti-material particle. But unless he elevates himself to the region of the anti-material worlds by cultivation of anti-material activities, he is destroyed materially at the annihilation of the material worlds and is subject to take rebirth in a material shape with the rebirth of a new material universe. In other words, he is subject to the pains of repeated birth and death. Only those living entities who take to the loving service of the Personality of Godhead during the manifested stage of material life are undoubtedly transferred to the anti-material worlds after quitting the material body. Immortality is obtained only by those who return to Godhead by practice of anti-material activities."
    }, {
      "text" : "What are these anti-material activities? They are medicines. For example, when a man falls ill, he goes to a physician who prescribes medicines which eventually cure the suffering patient. Similarly, the materialist is ailing, and he should consult an expert transcendentalist-physician. What is his ailment? He is suffering the tribulations of repeated births, deaths, diseases and old age. Once he agrees to put himself under the \"back to Godhead\" treatment, he is able to transfer himself to the anti-material world, where there is eternal life instead of birth and death.  Annihilation of the material world takes place in two ways. Partial annihilation occurs at the end of every 4,300,000 x 1,000 solar years, or at the end of each day of Brahmaloka, which is the topmost planet in the material world. During that time of partial annihilation, the topmost planets such as Brahmaloka are not annihilated, but at the end of each duration of 4,300,000 x 1,000 x 2 x 30 x 12 x 100 solar years, the entire cosmic manifestation is merged into the anti-material body from whence the material principles emanate, manifest and merge after annihilation. The anti-material world, which is far removed from the material sky, is never annihilated. It absorbs the material world. It may be that a \"clash\" occurs between the material and anti-material worlds, as suggested by the scientists, and that the material worlds are destroyed, but there is no annihilation of the anti-material worlds. The eternally existing anti-material world is unmanifested to the material scientist. He can simply have information of it insofar as the principles of its existence are contrary to the modes of the material world. Full details of the anti-material universe can be known only from the infallible source of liberated authorities who have thoroughly realized the constitution of the anti-material principle. This information is received by aural reception by a submissive disciple of the Personality of Godhead."

      "text" : "The Vedic knowledge was thus imparted unto the heart of Brahmā, the first living being in the material creation. It was Brahmā who related this knowledge to the sage Nārada Muni. Similarly, the Bhagavad-gītā was spoken by the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, to Vivasvān, the presiding deity of the sun, and when the aural chain of disciplic succession was broken, Lord Kṛṣṇa repeated the Bhagavad-gītā to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. At that time, Arjuna took the role of disciple and student in order to receive transcendental knowledge from Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In order to drive out all misgivings which the gross materialists of the world may have, Arjuna asked all relevant questions, and the answers were given by Kṛṣṇa so that any layman can understand them. Only those who are captivated by the glamour of the material world cannot accept the authority of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. One has to become thoroughly clean in habit and heart before one can understand the details of the anti-material world. Bhakti-yoga is a detailed scientific transcendental activity that both the neophyte and the perfect yogī can practice.  The material world is only a shadow representation of the anti-material world, and intelligent men who are clean in heart and habit will be able to learn, in a nutshell, all the details of the anti-material world from the text of the Bhagavad-gītā, and these are in actuality more exhaustive than material details. The basic details are as follows:  The presiding Deity of the anti-material world is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who exists in His original personality as well as in His many plenary expansions. This personality and His plenary expansions can be known only by anti-material activities commonly known as bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. The Personality of Godhead is the supreme truth, and He is the whole anti-material principle. The material principle as well as the anti-material principle is an emanation from His person. He is the root of the complete tree. When water is poured onto the root of a tree, the branches and leaves are nourished automatically. And in the same way, when Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, is worshiped, all details of the material worlds are enlightened, and the heart of the devotee is nourished without his having to work in a materialistic way. This is the secret of the Bhagavad-gītā."

      "text" : "The process of entering into the anti-material worlds differs from materialistic processes. The individual living being can very easily enter the anti-material world by practicing anti-material activities while residing in the material world. But those who are truly gross materialists, who depend on the limited strength of experimental thought, mental speculation and materialistic science, find great difficulty in entering the anti-material worlds. The gross materialist may try to approach the anti-material worlds by endeavoring with spaceships, satellites, rockets, etc., which he throws into outer space, but by such means he cannot even approach the material planets in the higher regions of the material sky, and what to speak of those planets situated in the anti-material sky, which is far beyond the material universe. Even the yogīs who have perfectly controlled mystic powers have great difficulty entering into that region. Master yogīs who control the anti-material particle within the material body by practice of mystic powers can give up their material bodies at will at a certain opportune moment and can thus enter the anti-material worlds through a specific thoroughfare which connects the material and anti-material worlds. If they are at all able, they act in accordance with the prescribed method given in the Bhagavad-gītā:  Those who have realized the Transcendence can reach the anti-material world by leaving their material bodies during the period of uttarāyana, that is, when the sun is on its northern path, or during auspicious moments in which the deities of fire and effulgence control the atmosphere.  The different deities, or powerful directing officers, are appointed to act in the administration of cosmic activities. Foolish people who are unable to see the intricacies of cosmic management laugh at the idea of personal management of fire, air, electricity, days, nights, etc., by demigods. But the perfect yogīs know how to satisfy these unseen administrators of material affairs and, taking advantage of the good will of these administrators, leave their material bodies at will during opportune moments arranged for entrance into the anti-material universe or into the highest planets of the material sky. In the higher planets of the material world, the yogīs can enjoy more comfortable and more pleasant lives for hundreds of thousands of years, but life in those higher planets is not eternal. Those who desire eternal life enter into the anti-material universe through mystic powers at certain opportune moments created by the demigod-administrators of cosmic affairs, administrators unseen by the gross materialists who reside on this seventh-class planet called \"Earth.\""

Their going forth takes place at a period known as dhūma, the dark, moonless half of the month, or when the sun is on its southern path.  In summary, the Bhagavad-gītā recommends that one adopt the means of devotional service, or anti-material activities, if one wishes to enter the anti-material world. Those who adopt the means of devotional service, as prescribed by the expert transcendentalist, are never disappointed in their attempts to enter the anti-material world. Although the obstacles are many, the devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa can easily overcome them by rigidly following the path outlined by the transcendental devotees. Such devotees, who are passengers progressing in the journey of life toward the anti-material kingdom of God, are never bewildered. No one is cheated or disappointed when he adopts the guaranteed path of devotion for entrance into the anti-material universe. One can easily attain all the results that are derived from the studies of the Vedas, performances of sacrifice, practices of penance and offerings of charities simply by the unilateral performance of devotional service, technically known as bhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga is therefore the great panacea for all, and it has been made easy to practice, especially in this iron age, by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself in His most sublime, liberal and munificent appearance as Lord Śrī Caitanya (1486-1534), who appeared in Bengal and spread the saṅkīrtana movement—singing, dancing, and chanting the names of God—throughout India. By Lord Caitanya's grace, one can quickly pick up the principles of bhakti-yoga. Thus all misgivings in the heart will disappear, the fire of material tribulation will be extinguished, and transcendental bliss will be ushered in."

The Russian astronomer also confirms that all the planets—which are estimated to be not less than one hundred million—are inhabited. In the Brahma-saṁhitā there is indication that in each and every one of the infinite number of universes there are infinite numbers of variegated planets.  The astronomer's view was seconded by Professor Vladimir Alpatov, a biologist, who maintained that some of the above-mentioned planets had reached a state of development corresponding to that of the earth. The report from Moscow continued:  It could be that life, similar to that on Earth, flourishes on such planets. Doctor of Chemistry Nikolai Zhirov, covering the problem of atmosphere on the planets, pointed out that the organism of a Martian, for instance, could very well adapt itself to normal existence with a low body temperature. He said that he felt that the gaseous composition of the atmosphere of Mars was quite suitable to sustain life of beings which have become adapted to it."

      "text" : "The adaptability of organisms in different varieties of planets is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā as vibhūti-bhinnam, i.e., each and every one of the innumerable planets within the universes is endowed with a particular type of atmosphere, and the living beings there are advanced in science, psychology, etc., according to the superiority or inferiority of the atmosphere. Vibhūti means \"specific power,\" and bhinnam means \"variegated.\" Scientists who are attempting to explore outer space in an attempt to reach other planets by mechanical means must realize that organisms adapted to the atmosphere of the earth cannot exist in the atmospheres of other planets. As such, man's attempts to reach the moon, the sun, or Mars will be completely futile because of the different atmospheres prevailing on those planets. Individually, however, one can attempt to go to any planet he desires, but this is only possible by psychological changes in the mind. Mind is the nucleus of the material body. The gradual evolutionary progress of the material body depends on psychological changes within the mind. The change of the bodily construction of a worm into that of a butterfly and, in modern medical science, the conversion of a man's body into that of a woman (or vice versa) are more or less dependent on psychological changes.  In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that if a man, at the time of death, concentrates his mind upon the form of the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and while so doing relinquishes his body, he at once enters the spiritual existence of the anti-material world. This means that anyone who trains the mind to turn from matter to the spiritual form of the Godhead by performance of the prescribed rules of devotional service can easily attain the kingdom of God, in the anti-material sky. And of this there is no doubt.  And in the same way, if one desires to enter into any other planet of the material sky, he can go there just after quitting the present body (i.e., after death). Thus if someone wants to go to the moon, the sun or Mars, he can do so simply by performing acts for that purpose. The Bhagavad-gītā confirms this statement in the following words:"

      "text" : "That upon which a person meditates at the time of death, quitting his body absorbed in the thought thereof, that particular thing he attains after death.  Mahārāja Bharata, despite a life of severe penances, thought of a stag at the time of his death and thus became a stag after death. However, he did retain a clear consciousness of his past life and realized his mistake. It is important to realize that one's thoughts at the time of death are influenced by the actual deeds which one performs during his life.  In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (Third Canto, Chapter Thirty-two), the process of entering the moon is described as follows:  Materialistic-minded men, who have no information of the kingdom of God, are always mad after material acquisition of wealth, fame and adoration. Such men are interested in the progressive weal of their particular family unit for their own self-satisfaction and so are also interested in the progress of social and national welfare. These men attain their desired objects by material activities. They are mechanically engaged in the ritualistic discharge of prescribed duties and are consequently inclined to satisfy the Pitās, or bygone forefathers, and controlling demigods by performance of sacrifices as prescribed by the revealed scriptures. Addicted to such acts of sacrifices and ceremonial observances, such souls enter into the moon after death. When one is thus promoted to the moon, he receives the capacity to enjoy the drinking of soma-rasa, a celestial beverage. The moon is a place where the demigod Candra is the predominating deity. The atmosphere and amenities of life there are far more comfortable and advantageous than those here on earth. After reaching the moon, if a soul does not utilize the opportunity for promotion to better planets, he is degraded and forced to return to earth or a similar planet. However, materialistic persons, although they may attain to the topmost planetary system, are certainly annihilated at the time of the cosmic manifestation's dissolution."

      "text" : "As far as the planetary system of the spiritual sky is concerned, there are unlimited Vaikuṇṭha planets in the para-vyoma. The Vaikuṇṭhas are spiritual planets which are manifestations of the internal potency of the Lord, and the ratio of these planets to the material planets (external energy) in the material sky is three to one. So the poor materialist is busy making political adjustments on a planet which is most insignificant in God's creation. To say nothing of this planet earth, the whole universe with innumerable planets throughout the galaxies is comparable to a grain of mustard seed in a bag full of mustard seeds. But the poor materialist makes plans to live comfortably here and thus wastes his valuable human energy in something which is doomed to frustration. Instead of wasting his time with business speculations, he might have sought the life of plain living and high spiritual thinking and thus saved himself from perpetual materialistic unrest.  Even if a materialist wants to enjoy developed material facilities, he can transfer himself to planets where he can experience material pleasures much more advanced than those available on the earth planet. But the best plan is to prepare oneself to return to the spiritual sky after leaving the body. However, if one is intent on enjoying material facilities, one can transfer himself to other planets in the material sky by utilizing yogic powers. The playful spaceships of the astronauts are but childish entertainments and are of no use for this purpose.  The aṣṭāṅga-yoga system is also materialistic, inasmuch as it teaches one to control the movements of air within the material body. The spiritual spark, the soul, is floating on air within the body, and inhalation and exhalation are the waves of that air containing the soul. Therefore the yoga system is a materialistic art of controlling this air by transferring it from the stomach to the navel, from the chest to the collarbone and from there to the eyeballs and from there to the cerebellum and from there to any desired planet. The velocities of air and light are taken into consideration by the material scientist, but he has no information of the velocity of the mind and intelligence. We have some limited experience of the velocity of the mind, because in a moment we can transfer our minds to places hundreds of thousands of miles away. Intelligence is even finer. Finer than intelligence is the soul, which is not matter like mind and intelligence but is spirit, or antimatter. The soul is hundreds of thousands of times finer and more powerful than intelligence. We can thus only imagine the velocity of the soul in its traveling from one planet to another. Needless to say, the soul travels by its own strength and not with the help of any kind of material vehicle."

      "text" : "The bestial civilization of eating, sleeping, fearing and sense-gratifying has misled modern man into forgetting how powerful a soul he has. As we have already described, the soul is a spiritual spark which is many, many times more illuminating, dazzling and powerful than sun, moon or electricity. Human life is spoiled when man does not realize his real identity with his soul. Lord Caitanya appeared with His disciple Nityānanda to save man from this type of misleading civilization.  Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also describes how yogīs can travel to all the planets in the universe. When the vital force is lifted to the cerebellum, there is every chance of this force bursting out from the eyes, nose, ears, etc., as these are places which are known as the seventh orbit of the vital force. But the yogīs can block out these holes by complete suspension of air. The yogī then concentrates the vital force in the middle position, that is, between the eyebrows. At this position, the yogī can think of the planet into which he wants to enter after leaving the body. He can then decide whether he wants to go to the abode of Kṛṣṇa in the transcendental Vaikuṇṭhas from which he will not be required to descend into the material world, or to travel to higher planets in the material universe. The perfect yogī is at liberty to do either.  For the perfect yogī who has attained success in the method of leaving his body in perfect consciousness, transferring from one planet to another is as easy as an ordinary man's walking to the grocery store. As already discussed, the material body is just a covering of the spiritual soul. Mind and intelligence are the undercoverings, and the gross body of earth, water, air, etc., is the overcoating of the soul. As such, any advanced soul who has realized himself by the yogic process, who knows the relationship between matter and spirit, can leave the gross dress of the soul in perfect order and as he desires. By the grace of God, we have complete freedom. Because the Lord is kind to us, we can live anywhere—either in the spiritual sky or in the material sky, upon whichever planet we desire. However, misuse of this freedom causes one to fall down into the material world and suffer the threefold miseries of conditioned life. The living of a miserable life in the material world by dint of the soul's choice is nicely illustrated by Milton in Paradise Lost. Similarly, by choice the soul can regain paradise and return home, back to Godhead."

      "text" : "At the critical time of death, one can place the vital force between the two eyebrows and decide where he wants to go. If he is reluctant to maintain any connection with the material world, he can, in less than a second, reach the transcendental Vaikuṇṭha and appear there completely in his spiritual body which will be suitable for him in the spiritual atmosphere. He has simply to desire to leave the material world in both finer and grosser forms and then move the vital force to the topmost part of the skull and leave the body from the hole in the skull called the brahma-randhra. This is the highest perfection in the practice of yoga.  Of course man is endowed with free will, and as such if he does not want to free himself of the material world he may enjoy the life of brahma-pāda (occupation of the post of Brahmā) and visit Siddhaloka, the planets of materially perfect beings who have full abilities to control gravity, space, time, etc. To visit these higher planets in the material universe, one need not give up his mind and intelligence (finer matter), but need only give up grosser matter (the material body).  Man-made satellites and mechanical space vehicles will never be able to carry human beings to the planets of outer space. Men cannot even go on their much-advertised trips to the moon, for, as we have already stated, the atmosphere on such higher planets is different from the atmosphere here on earth. Each and every planet has its particular atmosphere, and if one wants to travel to any particular planet within the material universe, one has to have a material body exactly adapted to the climatic condition of that planet. For instance, if one wants to go from India to Europe, where the climatic condition is different, one has to change his dress accordingly. Similarly, a complete change of body is necessary if one wants to go to the transcendental planets of Vaikuṇṭha."
    }, {
      "text" : "If one wants to go to the higher material planets, he can keep his finer dress of mind, intelligence and ego, but has to leave his gross dress (body) made of earth, water, fire, etc. When one goes to a transcendental planet, however, it is necessary to change both the finer and gross bodies, for one has to reach the spiritual sky completely in a spiritual form. This change of dress will take place automatically at the time of death if one so desires. But this desire is possible at death only if the desire is cultivated during life. Where one's treasures are, there also is one's heart. When one practices devotional service, one cultivates a desire for the kingdom of God. The following details outline a general practice by which one can prepare himself for an easy journey to the Vaikuṇṭha (anti-material) planets, where life is free from birth, old age, disease and death.  General practice (positive functions):  1. The serious candidate must accept a bona fide spiritual master in order to be trained scientifically. Because the senses are material, it is not at all possible to realize the Transcendence by them. Therefore the senses have to be spiritualized by the prescribed method under the direction of the spiritual master.  2. When the student has chosen a bona fide spiritual master, he must take the proper initiation from him. This marks the beginning of spiritual training.  3. The candidate must be prepared to satisfy the spiritual master in every way. A bona fide spiritual master who is fully cognizant of the methods of spiritual science, learned in the spiritual scriptures such as the Bhagavad-gītā, Vedānta, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Upaniṣads, and who is also a realized soul who has made a tangible connection with the Supreme Lord, is the transparent medium by which the willing candidate is led to the path of the Vaikuṇṭhas. The spiritual master must be satisfied in all respects, because simply by his good wishes a candidate can make wonderful progress along the path."

      "text" : "4. The intelligent candidate places intelligent questions to the spiritual master in order to clear his path of all uncertainties. The spiritual master shows the way, not whimsically, but in accordance with the principles of the authorities who have actually traversed the path. The names of these authorities are disclosed in the scriptures, and one has simply to follow them under the direction of the spiritual master. The spiritual master never deviates from the path of the authorities.  5. The candidate should always try to follow in the footsteps of the great sages who have practiced the method and obtained success. This should be taken as a motto in life. One should not superficially imitate them, but should follow them sincerely in terms of the particular time and circumstances.  6. The candidate must be prepared to change his habits in terms of the instructions contained in the books of authority, and for the satisfaction of the Lord he must be prepared to sacrifice both sense gratification and sense abnegation, following the example of Arjuna.  7. The candidate should live in a spiritual atmosphere.  8. He must be satisfied with as much wealth as is sufficient for maintenance only. He should not try to amass more wealth than is necessary to sustain himself in a simple way.  9. He must observe the fasting dates, such as the eleventh day of the growing and waning moon.  10. He must show respect to the banyan tree, the cow, the learned brāhmaṇa and the devotee."

      "text" : "These are the first stepping-stones toward the path of devotional service. Gradually one has to adopt other items, which are negative in character:  11. One should avoid offenses in the discharge of devotional service and in chanting the holy names.  12. He should avoid extensive association with nondevotees.  13. He must not take on unlimited disciples. This means that a candidate who has successfully followed the first twelve items can also become a spiritual master himself, just as a student becomes a monitor in class with a limited number of disciples.  14. He must not pose himself as a vastly learned man simply by quoting statements in books. He must have solid knowledge of the necessary books without superfluous knowledge in others.  15. A regular and successful practice of the above fourteen items will enable the candidate to maintain mental equilibrium even amidst great trials of material loss and gain.  16. In the next stage, the candidate does not become afflicted by lamentation and illusion.  17. He does not deride another's mode of religion or worship, nor does he deride the Personality of Godhead or His devotees.  18. He never tolerates blasphemy against the Lord or His devotees.  19. He should not indulge in the discussion of topics dealing with the relationship between man and woman; nor should he engage in useless topics concerning others' family affairs.  20. He should not inflict pain—either in body or in mind—upon other living beings, whomsoever they may be.  Out of the above twenty items, the first three positive items are imperative and most essential for the serious candidate."

These were selected owing to the present conditions of civic life. They are as follows:  1. One should associate with the devotees. Association with devotees is made possible by hearing them attentively, by asking them relevant questions, by supplying them food and by accepting food from them, and by giving them charity and by accepting from them whatever they offer.  2. One should chant the holy name of the Lord in all circumstances. The chanting of the Lord's name is an easy and inexpensive process of realization. One can chant any of the innumerable names of the Lord at any time. One should try to avoid offenses. There are ten offenses which one can commit while chanting the transcendental names, and these should be avoided as far as possible, but in any event, one should try to chant the holy names of the Lord at all times.  3. One should hear the transcendental topics enunciated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. This hearing is made possible through platform lectures by bona fide devotees and by authorized translations of the Bhāgavatam.  4. One should make his home at Mathurā, the birthplace of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Or one may make his home as good as Mathurā by installing the Deity of the Lord to be worshiped by all members of the family after proper initiation from the spiritual master.  5. One should worship the installed Deity with attention and devotion so that the whole atmosphere of one's home becomes the replica of the Lord's abode. This is made possible by the direction of the spiritual master who knows the transcendental art and can show the candidate the proper method."
    }, {
      "text" : "The above five items can be adopted by any man in any part of the world. Thus anyone can prepare himself for returning home, back to Godhead, by the simple method recognized by authorities such as Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who specifically advented Himself to deliver the fallen souls of this age.  For further details on this subject, one should read literatures like the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, of which we have presented an English summary study entitled The Nectar of Devotion.  The whole process of transferring oneself to the spiritual sky involves gradually liquidating the material composition of the gross and subtle coverings of the spirit soul. The above-mentioned five items of devotional activities are so spiritually powerful that their performance by a devotee, even in the preliminary stage, can very quickly promote the sincere executor to the stage of bhāva (the stage just prior to love of Godhead), or emotion on the spiritual plane, which is transcendental to mental and intellectual functions. A complete absorption in bhāva, or love of God, makes one fit to be transferred to the spiritual sky just after leaving the material tabernacle. The perfection of love of God by a devotee actually situates him on the spiritual platform, even though he may still maintain a gross material body. He becomes like a red-hot iron which, when in contact with fire, actually ceases to be iron and acts like fire. These things are made possible by the Lord's inscrutable and inconceivable energy, which material science has not the scope to calculate. One should therefore engage himself in devotional service with absolute faith, and to make his faith steadfast one should seek the association of the standard devotees of the Lord by personal association (if possible) or by thinking of them. This association will help one develop factual devotional service to the Lord, which will cause all material misgivings to disappear like a flash of lightning. All these different stages of spiritual realization will be personally felt by the candidate, and this will create in him a firm belief that he is making positive progress on the way to the spiritual sky. Then he will become sincerely attached to the Lord and His abode. Such is the gradual process of evolving love of God, which is the prime necessity for the human form of life."

      "text" : "There are instances in history of great personalities, including sages and kings, who attained perfection by this process. Some of them attained success even by adhering to one single item of devotional service with faith and perseverance. Some of these personalities are listed below.  1. Emperor Parīkṣit attained the spiritual platform simply by hearing from such an authority as Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī.  2. Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī attained the same simply by recitation, verbatim, of the transcendental message which he received from his great father, Śrī Vyāsadeva.  3. Emperor Prahlāda attained spiritual success by remembering the Lord constantly, in pursuance of instructions given by Śrī Nārada Muni, the great saint and devotee.  4. Lakṣmījī, the goddess of fortune, attained success simply by sitting and serving the lotus feet of the Lord.  5. King Pṛthu attained success simply by worshiping the Lord.  6. Akrūra, the charioteer, attained success simply by chanting prayers for the Lord.  7. Hanumān (Mahāvīra), the famous nonhuman devotee of Lord Śrī Rāmacandra, attained success simply by carrying out the orders of the Lord.  8. Arjuna, the great warrior, attained the same perfection simply by making friends with the Lord, who delivered the message of Bhagavad-gītā to enlighten Arjuna and his followers.  9. Emperor Bali attained success by surrendering everything unto the Lord, including his personal body."

      "text" : "These are nine standard modes of devotional service to the Lord, and a candidate can choose to adopt any one, two, three, four or all, however he likes. All the services rendered to the Absolute are in themselves absolute, with none of the quantitative or qualitative differences found on the material platform. On the spiritual platform everything is identical with everything else, although there is transcendental variegatedness. Emperor Ambarīṣa adopted all the above nine items, and he attained perfect success. It was he who engaged his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord, his voice in describing the spiritual world, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in submissively hearing the words of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, his eyes in viewing the Deities of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his nostrils in smelling the flowers offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the food offered to the Lord, his legs in visiting the temple of the Lord, and all the energy of his life in executing the services of the Lord without in the least desiring his own sense gratification. All these activities helped him attain the perfect stage of life which defeats all dexterities of material science.  It is therefore important for all human beings to adopt these principles of spiritual realization for the perfection of life. A human being's only obligation is spiritual realization. Unfortunately, in modern civilization, human society is too busy in discharging national duties. Actually, national duties, social duties and humanitarian duties are obligatory only to those who are bereft of spiritual duties. As soon as a man takes his birth on this earth, not only does he have national, social and humanitarian obligations, but he also has obligations to the demigods who supply air, light, water, etc. He also has obligations to the great sages who have left behind them vast treasure-houses of knowledge to guide him through life. He has obligations to all kinds of living beings, to his forefathers, family members and so forth and so on. But as soon as one engages himself in the one single obligatory duty—the duty of spiritual perfection—then he automatically liquidates all other obligations without having to make separate efforts."

      "text" : "A devotee of the Lord is never a disturbing element in society—on the contrary, he is a great social asset. Since no sincere devotee is attracted to sinful actions, as soon as a man becomes a pure devotee he can do inestimable selfless service to society for the peace and prosperity of all concerned, in this life and in the next. But even if such a devotee commits some offense, the Lord Himself rectifies it in no time. Therefore, there is no need for a devotee to cultivate materialistic knowledge, nor does a devotee need to renounce everything and live as a hermit. He can simply remain at home and execute devotional service smoothly in any order of life. And there are instances in history of extremely cruel men becoming kindhearted simply by the execution of devotional service. Knowledge and abnegation of an inferior way of life follow automatically in the life of a pure devotee without his having to make extraneous effort.  This spiritual art and science of devotional service is the highest contribution of Indian sages to the rest of the world. Therefore everyone who has taken his birth in India has an obligation to perfect his life by adopting the principles of this great art and science and distributing it to the rest of the world, which is still ignorant of the ultimate aim of life. Human society is destined to reach this stage of perfection by gradual development of knowledge. Indian sages, however, have already reached that position. Why do others have to wait for thousands and thousands of years to attain their heights? Why not give them the information immediately in a systematic way, so that they may save time and energy? They should take advantage of a life for which they may have labored millions of years to attain.  A Russian fiction writer is now contributing suggestions to the rest of the world that scientific progress can help man to live forever. Of course, he does not believe in a Supreme Being who is the creator. Yet we welcome his suggestion because we know that actual progress in scientific knowledge will certainly take men to the spiritual sky and inform the scientist that there is a supreme creator who has full potencies beyond all materialistic scientific conceptions."

      "text" : "As mentioned, every living being is eternal in form, but he has to change his outer coverings, gross and subtle, and this changing process is technically known as life and death. As long as a living being has to put on the shackles of material bondage, there is no relief from this changing process, which continues even in the highest stage of material life. The Russian fiction writer may speculate, as fiction writers are apt to do, but saner people with some knowledge of natural law will not agree that man can life forever within this material world.  A naturalist can see the general course of material nature simply by studying a piece of fruit. A small fruit develops from a flower, grows, stays for some time on a branch, becomes full-grown, ripens, then begins to dwindle daily until it finally falls from the tree and commences to decompose into the earth and at last mingles with the earth, leaving behind its seed which in its turn grows to become a tree and produces many fruits in time, which will all meet the same fate, and so on and so on.  Similarly, a living being (as a spiritual spark, a part of the Supreme Being) takes its organic form in the womb of a mother just after sexual intercourse. It grows little by little within the womb, is born, then continues growing, becomes a child, boy, youth, adult, old man, then finally dwindles and meets death, despite all the good wishes and hopeful pipe dreams of fiction writers. By comparison, there is no difference between man and the fruit. Like the fruit, the man may leave behind him his seeds of numerous children, but he cannot exist eternally within his material body due to the law of material nature.  How can anyone ignore the law of material nature? No material scientist can change the stringent laws of nature, however boastful he may be. No astronomer or scientist can change the course of the planets—he can only manufacture a paltry toy planet which he calls a satellite. Foolish children may be impressed by this and may give a great deal of credit to the inventors of modern satellites, sputniks, etc., but the saner section of humanity gives more credit to the creator of the gigantic satellites, namely the sun, stars and planets of which the material scientist can see no end. If a small toy satellite has a creator in Russia or America, it is reasonable that the gigantic satellites have their creator in the spiritual sky. If a toy satellite requires so many scientific brains for its manufacture and its orbiting, what kind of subtle and perfect brain created galaxies of stars and maintains them in their orbits? Thus far the atheistic class have not been able to answer this."

This only means that their information has no authoritative basis and is not backed by scientific data. They simply speculate. However, authorized information is available in the Bhagavad-gītā. For instance, the Bhagavad-gītā informs us that within the material world there are living beings whose duration of life covers 4,300,000 x 1,000 x 2 x 30 x 12 x 100 solar years. We accept the Bhagavad-gītā as authority because this book of knowledge was so accepted by India's great sages like Śaṅkarācārya, Śrī Rāmānujācārya, Śrī Madhvācārya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Bhagavad-gītā indicates that in the material world all component forms are subject to decay and death, regardless of their duration of life.  Therefore all material shapes are subject to the law of change, although potentially the material energy is conserved. Potentially, everything is eternal, but in the material world matter takes shape, remains for some time, develops into maturity, grows old, begins to dwindle and at last disappears again. This is the case with all material objects. The materialist's suggestion that beyond the material sky there is \"some other form\" which is beyond the boundary of visibility and which is strange and inconceivable is but a faint indication of the spiritual sky. However, the basic principle of spirit is much closer—for it functions within all living beings. When that spiritual principle is out of the material body, then the material body has no life. Within the body of a child, for instance, the spiritual principle is present, and therefore changes take place in the body and it develops. But if the spirit leaves the body, the development stops. This law is applicable to every material object. Matter transforms from one shape to another when it is in contact with spirit. Without spirit there is no transformation. The entire universe develops in that way. It emanates from the energy of the Transcendence because of the spiritual force which is His, and it develops into gigantic forms like the sun, moon, earth, etc. There are fourteen divisions of planetary systems, and although they are all different in dimension and quality, the same principle of development holds true for all. The spiritual force is the creator, and by this spiritual principle only, transformation, transition and development take place."

      "text" : "Life is definitely not generated simply by a material reaction like a chemical combination, as many foolish men claim. Material interaction is set in motion by a superior being who creates a favorable circumstance to accommodate the spiritual living force. The superior energy handles matter in an appropriate way—as determined by the free will of the spiritual being. For example, building materials do not automatically \"react\" and suddenly assume the shape of a residential house. The living spiritual being handles matter appropriately by his free will and thus constructs his house. Similarly, matter is the ingredient only, but the spirit is the creator. Only a man with a poor fund of knowledge avoids this conclusion. The creator may remain unseen in the background, but that does not mean that there is no creator. One should not be illusioned simply by the gigantic form of the material universe. Rather, one should learn to discern the existence of supreme intelligence behind all these material manifestations. The Supreme Being, who is the supreme intelligence, is the ultimate creator, the all-attractive Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Although one may not be aware of this, there is definite information of the creator given in Vedic literatures such as the Bhagavad-gītā and especially the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.  When a satellite is thrown into outer space, a child may not understand that there are scientific brains behind it, but an intelligent adult realizes that scientific brains on earth are controlling the satellite. Similarly, less intelligent persons do not have information of the creator and His eternal abode in the spiritual world, which is far beyond our range of visibility, but in actuality there is a spiritual sky, and spiritual planets which are more spacious and greater in number than planets in the material sky. From the Bhagavad-gītā we receive information that the material universe only constitutes a fraction (one fourth) of the creation. Such information is extensively available in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and in other Vedic literatures.  If living energy can be generated in the scientist's laboratory by \"the interaction of certain physical and chemical combinations,\" then why haven't the boastful material scientists been able to manufacture life? They should know definitely that spiritual force is distinct from matter and that such energy is not possible to produce by any amount of material adjustment. At present Russians and Americans are undoubtedly very much advanced in many departments of technological science, but they are still ignorant of the spiritual science. They will have to learn from superior intelligence in order to make a perfect and progressive human society."

It is further said that a man should only possess as much wealth as is sufficient to maintain his body, and that if he desires more than that, or if he takes more than his share, he is subject to punishment. It is also stated that animals should be treated as one's own children.  We believe that no nation on earth can describe socialism as well as the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Living beings other than humans can be treated as brothers and children only when one has a full conception of the creator and the actual constitution of the living being.  Man's desire to be deathless is realized only in the spiritual world. As stated at the beginning of this essay, a desire for eternal life is a sign of dormant spiritual life. The aim of human civilization should be targeted to that end. It is possible for every human being to transfer himself to that spiritual realm by the process of bhakti-yoga, as described herein. It is a great science, and India has produced many scientific literatures by which the perfection of life may be realized.  Bhakti-yoga is the eternal religion of man. At a time when material science predominates all subjects—including the tenets of religion—it would be enlivening to see the principles of the eternal religion of man from the viewpoint of the modern scientist.  Even Dr. S. Radhakrishnan admitted at a world religion conference that religion will not be accepted in modern civilization if it is not accepted from a scientific point of view. In reply, we are glad to announce to the lovers of the truth that bhakti-yoga is the eternal religion of the world and is intended for all living beings, who are all eternally related with the Supreme Lord."

      "text" : "Śrīpāda Rāmānujācārya defines the word sanātana, or \"eternal,\" as that which has neither beginning nor end. When we speak of sanātana-dharma, eternal religion, we take this definition for granted. That which has neither beginning nor end is unlike anything sectarian, which has limits and boundaries. In the light of modern science it will be possible for us to see sanātana-dharma as the main occupation of all the people of the world—nay, of all living entities of the universe. Non-sanātana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of man, but there is no historic origin of sanātana-dharma because it eternally remains with the living entities.  When a man professes to belong to a particular faith—Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or any other sect—and when he refers to a particular time and circumstance of birth, such designations are called non-sanātana-dharma. A Hindu may become a Muslim or a Muslim may become a Hindu or Christian, etc., but in all circumstances there is one constant. In all circumstances, he is rendering service to others. A Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist or Christian is in all circumstances a servant of someone. The particular type of faith professed is not sanātana-dharma. Sanātana-dharma is the constant companion of the living being, the unifier of all religions. Sanātana-dharma is the rendering of service.  In the Bhagavad-gītā there are several references to that which is sanātana. Let us learn the import of sanātana-dharma from this authority.  There is reference to the word sanātanam in the tenth verse of the Seventh Chapter, in which the Lord says that He is the eternal fountainhead of everything and is therefore sanātanam. The fountainhead of everything is described in the Upaniṣads as the complete whole. All emanations of the fountainhead are also complete in themselves, but although many complete units emanate from the complete sanātana fountainhead, the sanātana head does not diminish in quality or quantity.  The Lord claims to be the father of all species of life. He claims that all living beings—regardless of what they are—are part and parcel of Him. Consequently, the Bhagavad-gītā is meant for all of them. In the Gītā there is information of this sanātana nature of the Supreme Lord. There is also information of His abode, which is far beyond the material sky, and of the sanātana nature of the living beings."
    }, {
      "text" : "Lord Kṛṣṇa, in the Bhagavad-gītā, also informs us that this material world is full of miseries in the shape of birth, old age, disease and death. Even in the topmost planet of the material universe, Brahmaloka, these miseries are present. Only in His own abode is there a total absence of misery. In that abode there is no need of light from sun, moon or fire. The planets are self-luminous. Life there is perpetual and full of knowledge and bliss. That is what is known as sanātana-dharma. It is therefore natural to conclude that the living entities must return home, back to Godhead, to enjoy life in the sanātana-dhāma with the sanātana-puruṣa, or the puruṣottama, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They must not remain to rot in this miserable land of material existence. There is no happiness in the material sphere—even in Brahmaloka—so plans and activities for elevation to higher planets within the material universe are carried out by those who are less intelligent. Less intelligent men also take shelter of demigods and only derive benefits which endure for a limited period. Thus their religious principles and the benefits derived therefrom are only temporary. The intelligent man, however, abandons all engagements in the name of religion and takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus receives absolute protection from the Almighty Father. Sanātana-dharma is therefore the process of bhakti-yoga, by which one can come to know the sanātana Lord and His sanātana abode. By this process only can one return to the spiritual universe, the sanātana-dhāma, to take part in the sanātana enjoyment prevailing there.  Those who are followers of sanātana-dharma may henceforward take up those principles in the spirit of the Bhagavad-gītā. There is nothing barring anyone from adopting the eternal principles. Even persons who are less enlightened can return to Godhead. This is the version taught by Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and by the Supreme Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gītā. Mankind should be given a chance to take advantage of this opportunity. Because Bhagavad-gītā was spoken in the land of Bhārata-varṣa, every Indian has the responsibility to broadcast the message of real sanātana-dharma in the other parts of the world. Especially at the present moment, misguided men are suffering in the darkness of materialism, and their so-called learning has enabled them to discover the atomic bomb. They are consequently on the verge of annihilation. Sanātana-dharma, however, will teach them about the real purpose of life, and they will benefit by its propagation."

      "text" : "In these days, when men are trying to go to the moon, people should not think that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is concerned with something old-fashioned. When the world is progressing to reach the moon, we are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. But people should not misunderstand and assume that we are lagging behind modern scientific advancement. We have already passed all scientific advancement. In Bhagavad-gītā it is said that man's attempt to reach higher planets is not new. Newspaper headlines read, \"Man's First Steps on the Moon,\" but the reporters do not know that millions and millions of men went there and came back. This is not the first time. This is an ancient practice. In Bhagavad-gītā (8.16) it is clearly stated, abrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna: \"My dear Arjuna, even if you go to the highest planetary system, which is called Brahmaloka, you will have to come back.\" Therefore, interplanetary travel is not new. It is known to the Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees.  Since we are Kṛṣṇa conscious, we take what Kṛṣṇa says to be the Absolute Truth. According to Vedic literature, there are many planetary systems. The planetary system in which we are living is called Bhūrloka. Above this planetary system is Bhuvarloka. Above that is Svarloka (the moon belongs to the Svarloka planetary system). Above Svarloka is Maharloka; above that is Janaloka; and above that is Satyaloka. Similarly, there are lower planetary systems. Thus there are fourteen statuses of planetary systems within this universe, and the sun is the chief planet. The sun is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.52):  yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakro govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi  \"I worship Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], the primeval Lord, by whose order the sun assumes immense power and heat and traverses its orbit. The sun, which is the chief among all planetary systems, is the eye of the Supreme Lord.\" Actually, without the sun we cannot see. We may be very proud of our eyes, but we cannot even see our next-door neighbor. People challenge, \"Can you show me God?\" But what can they see? What is the value of their eyes? God is not cheap. We cannot see anything, not to speak of God, without sunshine. Without sunlight we are blind. At night, we cannot see anything, and therefore we use electricity because the sun is not present."

      "text" : "There is not only one sun in the cosmic manifestation; there are millions and trillions of suns. That is also stated in the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.40):  yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi- koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi  The spiritual bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is called the brahma-jyotir, and in that brahma-jyotir there are countless planets. Just as within the sunshine there are innumerable planets, in the shining effulgence of the body of Kṛṣṇa there are innumerable planets and universes. We have knowledge of many universes, and in each universe there is a sun. Thus there are millions and billions of universes and millions and billions of suns and moons and planets. But Kṛṣṇa says that if one tries to go to one of these planets, he will simply waste his time.  Now someone has gone to the moon, but what will human society gain from it? If, after spending so much money, so much energy and ten years of effort, one goes to the moon and simply touches it, what is the benefit of that? Can one remain there and call his friends to come? And even if one goes there and remains, what will be the benefit? As long as we are in this material world, either on this planet or other planets, the same miseries—birth, death, old age and disease—will follow us. We cannot rid ourselves of them.  If we go to live on the moon—assuming it is possible—even with an oxygen mask, how long could we stay? Furthermore, even if we had the opportunity to stay there, what would we gain? We might gain a little longer life perhaps, but we could not live there forever. That is impossible. And what would we gain by a longer life? Taravaḥ kiṁ na jīvanti: [SB 2.3.18] are not the trees living for many, many years? Near San Francisco I have seen a forest where there is a tree seven thousand years old. But what is the benefit? If one is proud of standing in one place for seven thousand years, that is not a very great credit."

      "text" : "How one goes to the moon, how he comes back, etc., is a great story, and this is all described in the Vedic literature. It is not a very new process. But the aim of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society is different. We are not going to waste our valuable time. Kṛṣṇa says, \"Don't waste your time attempting to go to this planet or to that planet. What will you gain? Your material miseries will follow you wherever you go.\" Therefore, in the Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Ādi 3.97) it is very nicely said by the author:  keha pāpe, keha puṇye kare viṣaya-bhoga bhakti-gandha nāhi, yāte yāya bhava-roga  \"In this material world someone is enjoying and someone is not enjoying, but actually everyone is suffering, although some people think that they are enjoying, whereas others realize that they are suffering.\" Actually everyone is suffering. Who in this material world does not suffer disease? Who does not suffer from old age? Who does not die? No one wants to grow old or suffer from disease, but everyone must do so. Where then is the enjoyment? This enjoyment is all nonsense because within this material world there is no enjoyment. It is simply our imagination. One should not think, \"This is enjoyment, and this is suffering.\" Everything is suffering! Therefore, it is stated in the Caitanya-caritāmṛta, \"The principles of eating, sleeping, mating and defending will always exist, but they will exist in different standards.\" For example, the Americans have taken birth in America as a result of pious activities performed in previous lifetimes. In India the people are poverty-stricken and are suffering, but although the Americans are eating very nicely buttered bread and the Indians are eating without butter, they are both eating nevertheless. The fact that India is poverty-stricken has not caused the whole population to die for want of food. The four principal bodily demands—eating, sleeping, mating and defending—can be satisfied under any circumstances, whether one is born in an impious condition or in a pious condition. The problem, however, is how to become free from the four principles of birth, death, old age and disease.  This is the real problem. It is not \"What shall I eat?\" The birds and beasts have no such problem. In the morning they are immediately chirping, \"Jee, jee, jee, jee.\" They know that they will have their food. No one is dying, and there is no such thing as overpopulation because everyone is provided for by God's arrangement. There are qualitative differences, but obtaining a superior quality of material enjoyment is not the end of life. The real problem is how to get free of birth, death, old age and disease. This cannot be solved by simply wasting time traveling within this universe. Even if one goes to the highest planet, this problem cannot be solved, for there is death everywhere."

      "text" : "The duration of life on the moon, according to Vedic information, is ten thousand years, and one day there is equal to six months here. Thus ten thousand multiplied by one hundred eighty years is the duration of life on the moon. However, it is impossible for earthmen to go to the moon and live there for very long. Otherwise the whole Vedic literature would be false. We can attempt to go there, but it is not possible to live there. This knowledge is in the Vedas. Therefore, we are not very eager to go to this planet or that planet. We are eager to go directly to the planet where Kṛṣṇa lives. Kṛṣṇa states in Bhagavad-gītā (9.25):  yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā yānti mad-yājino 'pi mām  \"One can go to the moon, or one can even go to the sun or to millions and trillions of other planets, or if one is too materially attached he may remain here—but those who are My devotees will come to Me.\" This is our aim. Initiation into Kṛṣṇa consciousness insures that the student ultimately can go to the supreme planet, Kṛṣṇaloka. We are not sitting idly; we are also attempting to go to other planets, but we are not merely wasting time.  A sane and intelligent man does not wish to enter any of the material planets because the four conditions of material miseries exist on all of them. From Bhagavad-gītā we can understand that even if we enter Brahmaloka, the highest planetary system of this universe, the four principles of misery will be present. We learn from Bhagavad-gītā that the duration of one day on Brahmaloka is millions of years of our calculation. That is a fact.  Even the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, may be reached, but scientists say that it will take forty thousand years at sputnik speed. Who is prepared to travel in space for forty thousand years? From the Vedic literature we can understand that we can enter any of the planets, provided we prepare for that purpose. If one prepares himself to enter into the higher planetary systems, which are said to be inhabited by demigods, he can go there. Similarly, one can go to a lower planetary system, or if one desires he can remain on this planet. Finally, if one desires, he can enter the planet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is all a matter of preparation. However, all planetary systems within our material universe are temporary. The duration of life on certain material planets may be very long, but all living entities in the material universe are eventually subject to annihilation and have to again develop other bodies. There are different types of bodies. A human body exists one hundred years, whereas an insect body may exist for twelve hours. Thus the duration of these different bodies is relative. If one enters the planet called Vaikuṇṭhaloka, the spiritual planet. however, he then achieves eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge. A human being can attain that perfection if he tries. That is stated in Bhagavad-gītā when the Lord says, \"Anyone who knows in truth about the Supreme Personality of Godhead can attain to My nature.\""

      "text" : "Many people claim, \"God is great,\" but this is a hackneyed phrase. One must know how He is great, and that can be known from authorized scripture. In the Bhagavad-gītā God describes Himself. He says, \"My appearance of taking birth just like an ordinary human being is actually transcendental.\" God is so kind that He comes before us as an ordinary human being, but His body is not exactly like a human body. Those rascals who do not know about Him think that Kṛṣṇa is like one of us. That is also stated in Bhagavad-gītā (9.11):  avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto mama bhūta-maheśvaram  \"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.\" We have a chance to know about Kṛṣṇa provided we read the right literature under the right direction, and if we simply know what the nature of God is, then by understanding this one fact alone we become liberated. It is not possible in our human condition to understand the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead completely, but with the help of Bhagavad-gītā, the statements given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and of the spiritual master, we can know Him to the best of our capacity. If we can know Him in reality, then immediately after leaving this body we can enter into the kingdom of God. Kṛṣṇa says, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna: \"After leaving this body, one who is in knowledge does not come again to this material world, for he enters into the spiritual world and comes to Me.\" (Bg. 4.9)  The purpose of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to propagate this advanced scientific idea to people in general, and the process is very simple. Simply by chanting the holy names of God—Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare—one cleanses the dirt from his heart and gains understanding that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and that it is his duty to serve Him. This process is very pleasant: we chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, we dance rhythmically, and we eat nice prasāda. While enjoying this life, we are preparing to enter into the kingdom of God in our next life. This is not a fabrication—it is all factual. Although to a layman this appears to be a fabrication, Kṛṣṇa reveals Himself from within to one who is serious about God realization. Both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master help the sincere soul. The spiritual master is the external manifestation of God, who is situated in everyone's heart as Supersoul. For one who is very serious about understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul immediately renders assistance by directing him to a bona fide spiritual master. In this way the spiritual candidate is helped from within and without."

      "text" : "According to the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, the Supreme Truth is realized in three stages. First there is impersonal Brahman, or the impersonal Absolute; then the Paramātmā, or localized aspect of Brahman. The neutron of the atom may be taken as the representation of Paramātmā, who also enters into the atom. This is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā. But ultimately the Supreme Divine Being is realized as the supreme all-attractive person (Kṛṣṇa) with full and inconceivable potencies of opulence, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. These six potencies are fully exhibited by Śrī Rāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa when They descend before human beings. Only a section of human beings—the unalloyed devotees—can recognize Kṛṣṇa on the authority of revealed scriptures, but others are bewildered by the influence of material energy. The Absolute Truth is therefore the Absolute Person who has no equal or competitor. The impersonal Brahman rays are the rays of His transcendental body, just as the sun's rays are emanations from the sun.  According to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, the material energy is called avidyā, or nescience, and is exhibited in the fruitive activities of sense enjoyment. But although the living being has the tendency to be illusioned and trapped by the material energy for sense enjoyment, he belongs to the anti-material energy, or spiritual energy. In this sense the living being is the positive energy, whereas matter is the negative energy. Matter does not develop unless in contact with the superior spiritual, or anti-material, energy, which is directly part and parcel of the spiritual whole. The subject matter of this spiritual energy exhibited by living beings is undoubtedly very complicated for an ordinary man, who is therefore astounded by the subject. Sometimes he partially understands it through the imperfect senses, and sometimes he fails to know it altogether. It is best, therefore, to hear from the highest authority, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or from His devotee who represents Him in the chain of disciplic succession.  This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for the purpose of understanding God. The spiritual master is the living representative of Kṛṣṇa who helps externally, and Kṛṣṇa as Supersoul helps internally. The living entity can take advantage of such guidance and make his life successful. We request that everyone read authoritative literature in order to understand this movement. We have published Bhagavad-gītā As It Is; Teachings of Lord Caitanya; Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam; Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; and The Nectar of Devotion. We are also publishing our magazine Back to Godhead every month in many languages. Our mission is to save human society from the pitfalls of incarnating again in the cycle of birth and death."

      "text" : "Everyone should attempt to go to Kṛṣṇa. We have published an article in our Back to Godhead magazine entitled \"Beyond the Universe.\" This article describes a place beyond this universe according to knowledge which is in Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā is a very popular book, and there are many editions of it in America and also many from India. Unfortunately, however, many rascals have come to the West to preach Bhagavad-gītā. They are designated as rascals because they are bluffers who do not give real information. In our Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, however, the spiritual nature is authoritatively described.  This cosmic manifestation is called \"nature,\" but there is another nature, which is superior. The cosmic manifestation is inferior nature, but beyond this nature, which is manifested and unmanifested, there is another nature, which is called sanātana, eternal. It is easy to understand that everything manifested here is temporary. The obvious example is our body. If one is thirty years old, thirty years ago his body was not manifested, and in another fifty years it will again be unmanifested. That is a factual law of nature. It is manifested and again annihilated, just as waves in the sea rise frequently and then recede. The materialist, however, is simply concerned with this mortal life, which can be finished at any moment. Furthermore, as this body will die, so the entire universe, this gigantic material body, will be annihilated, and whether we are fortunate or unfortunate, on this planet or another planet, everything will be finished. Why then are we wasting our time trying to go to a planet where everything will be finished? We should try to go to Kṛṣṇaloka. This is spiritual science; we must try to understand it, and, after understanding it ourselves, we should preach this message to the whole world. Everyone is in darkness. Although people have no knowledge, they are very proud. But it is not advancement of knowledge to go to the moon after ten years of effort and take a rock and come back. The space travelers are very proud: \"Oh, I have touched it.\" But what have they gained? Even if we were able to live there, it would not be for long. It will all be destroyed in the end.  Try to find that planet from which one will never return, where there is eternal life, and where one can dance with Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Take this movement seriously, for Kṛṣṇa consciousness gives one a chance to reach Kṛṣṇa and to dance with Him eternally. From Vedic literature we understand that this material world is a manifestation of only one fourth of the complete creation of God. The three-fourths portion of God's creation is the spiritual world. That we find in Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣṇa says, \"This material world is but a fractional part of the whole.\" If we look as far as we can see—up to the sky—our vision is still confined within only one universe, and there are unlimited universes clustered together within what is called the material world. But beyond those clusters of unlimited numbers of universes is the spiritual sky, which is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gītā, where the Lord says that beyond the material world is another nature, which is eternal; there is no history of its beginning, and it has no end. \"Eternal\" refers to that which has no end and no beginning. The Vedic religion is therefore called eternal because no one can trace back when it began. The Christian religion has a history of two thousand years, and the Muhammadan religion also has a history, but if one were to trace back Vedic religion, he would not find its historical beginning. Therefore it is called eternal religion."

      "text" : "We may rightly say that God created this material world, and this indicates that God existed before the creation. This very word \"created\" suggests that before the creation of the cosmic manifestation, the Lord was existing. Therefore God is not under the creation. If God were under the creation, how could He have created? He would instead have been one of the objects of this material creation. But God is not under the creation; He is the creator, and therefore He is eternal.  There is a spiritual sky, where there are innumerable spiritual planets and innumerable spiritual living entities, but those who are not fit to live in that spiritual world are sent to this material world. Voluntarily we have accepted this material body, but actually we are spirit souls who should not have accepted it. When and how we accepted it cannot be traced. No one can trace the history of when the conditioned soul first accepted the material body. There are 8,400,000 forms of living entities 900,000 species of living entities are within the water, 2,000,000 species of life are among the plants and vegetables. Unfortunately, this Vedic knowledge is not instructed by any university. But these are facts. Let the botanist and anthropologist research into the Vedic conclusion. Darwin's theory of the evolution of organic matter is, of course, very prominent in the institutions of learning. But the Bhāgavata Purāṇa and other authoritative scriptures of scientific magnitude describe how the living entities in different forms of body evolve one after another. It is not a new idea, but educators are giving stress only to Darwin's theory, although in Vedic literature we have immense information of the living conditions in this material world.  We are only a fractional portion of all the living entities in the many universes of the material world. Those who are in the material world and material body are condemned. For example, the population in prison is condemned by the government, but their number is only a fraction of the whole population. It is not that the whole population goes to prison; some, who are disobedient, are confined in prison. Similarly, the conditioned souls within this material world are only a fraction of all the living entities in the creation of God, and because they have disobeyed God—because they did not abide by the order of Kṛṣṇa—they have been put into this material world. If one is sensible and inquisitive, he should try to understand: \"Why have I been put into this conditional life? I do not wish to suffer.\""

      "text" : "There are three kinds of suffering, including miseries pertaining to the body and mind. In Hawaii, in front of my house, a man was keeping some animals and birds for the purpose of taking them to be slaughtered. I gave this example to my students: \"These animals are standing here, and if you tell them, 'Oh, my dear animals, why are you standing here? Go away! You are meant for the slaughterhouse,' they cannot go. They have no intelligence.\"  Suffering without knowledge, without remedy, is animal life. One who cannot understand that he is suffering and who thinks that he is very well off is in animal consciousness, not human consciousness. The human being should be cognizant of suffering the threefold miseries of this planet. One should know that he is suffering in birth, suffering in death, suffering in old age and suffering in disease, and one should be inquisitive as to how he may avoid the suffering. That is real research work.  We have suffered from the beginning of our birth. As a baby, the human being is tightly placed in the abdomen of the mother in an airtight bag for nine months. He cannot even move, there are insects biting him, and he cannot protest. After the child comes out, the suffering continues. The mother undoubtedly takes much care, but still the child cries because he is suffering. There are bugs biting or there are pains in his stomach; the child is crying, and the mother does not know how to pacify him. His suffering begins in the womb of his mother. Then, after his birth, as he grows up, there is more suffering. He does not want to go to school, but he is forced to. He does not want to study, but the teacher gives him tasks. If we analyze our life, we will find that it is full of suffering. Why then are we coming here? The conditioned souls are not very bright. We should inquire, \"Why am I suffering?\" If there is a remedy, we must take advantage of it.  We are eternally connected with the Supreme Lord, but somehow or other we are now in material contamination. Therefore, we must take up a process by which to go back again to the spiritual world. That linking process is called yoga. The actual translation of the word yoga is \"plus.\" At the present moment we are minus God, or minus the Supreme. But when we make ourselves plus—connected—then our human form of life is perfect. During our lifetime we have to practice approaching that point of perfection, and at the time of death, when we give up this material body, that perfection has to be realized. At the time of death, one must be prepared. Students, for instance, prepare for two to five years in college, and the final test of their education is the examination. If they pass the examination, they get a degree. Similarly, in the subject of life, if we prepare for the examination at the time of death and pass it, then we are transferred to the spiritual world. Everything is examined at the time of death."

Bhagavad-gītā describes what we should do at the point of our death, when we are giving up this present body. For the dhyāna-yogī (meditator) Śrī Kṛṣṇa speaks the following verses:  yad akṣaraṁ veda-vido vadanti viśanti yad yatayo vīta-rāgāḥ yad icchanto brahmacaryaṁ caranti tat te padaṁ saṅgraheṇa pravakṣye  sarva-dvārāṇi saṁyamya mano hṛdi nirudhya ca mūrdhny ādhāyātmanaḥ prāṇam āsthito yoga-dhāraṇām  \"Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter oṁkāra and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation. The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.\" (Bg. 8.11-12) In the yoga system this process is called pratyāhāra, which means, in technical language, \"the opposite.\" Now the eyes are engaged in seeing worldly beauty, so one has to withdraw them from enjoying that beauty and concentrate on seeing beauty inside. That is called pratyāhāra. Similarly, one has to hear the oṁkāra sound from within."

      "text" : "oṁ ity ekākṣaraṁ brahma vyāharan mām anusmaran yaḥ prayāti tyajan dehaṁ sa yāti paramāṁ gatim  \"After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable oṁ, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.\" (Bg. 8.13) In this way all the senses have to be stopped in their external activities, and the mind must be concentrated on viṣṇu-mūrti, the form of Lord Viṣṇu. That is the perfection of yoga. The mind is very turbulent, so it has to be fixed upon the heart. When the mind is fixed within the heart and the life air is transferred to the top of the head, one can attain the perfection of yoga.  The perfect yogī then determines where he is to go. There are innumerable material planets, and beyond these planets there is the spiritual world. Yogīs have this information from Vedic scriptures. For example, before I came to the United States I read descriptions of it from books. Similarly, a description of the higher planets and the spiritual world can be found in the Vedic scriptures. The yogī knows everything; he can transfer himself to any planet he likes. He does not need the help of spacecraft.  Material scientists have been trying for many years, and they will go on trying for one hundred or one thousand years more, but they will never reach any planet. Maybe by a scientific process one or two men can reach some planet, but that is not the general process. The generally accepted process for transferral to other planets is the practice of the yoga system or the jñāna system. The bhakti system, however, is not meant for transferral to any material planet. Those who engage in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Lord, are not interested in any of the planets of this material world because they know that no matter to which planet one elevates himself, he will still find the four principles of material existence there nonetheless. On some planets the duration of life is much longer than on this earth, but death is there. Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, however, transcend this material life of birth, death, disease and old age."

      "text" : "Spiritual life means release from this botheration and misery. Those who are intelligent, therefore, do not try to elevate themselves to any planet of this material world. Men are trying to reach the moon, and although it is very difficult to gain entrance to that planet, if we do gain entrance the period of our lives will be enhanced. Of course, that does not apply to life in this body. If we were to enter the moon with this body, instant death would be certain.  When one enters into a planetary system, he must have a suitable body for that planet. Every planet is inhabited by living entities with bodies suitable for that planet. For instance, we can enter the water in this body, but we cannot live there. We may stay there fifteen or sixteen hours, or maybe twenty-four hours, but that's all. Aquatic animals, however, have particular bodies suitable for living their whole lives in water. Similarly, if one takes a fish out of water and puts it on the land, it will die instantly. As we understand that even on this planet there are different kinds of bodies for living in particular places, so, similarly, if we want to enter another planet, we have to prepare ourselves to get a suitable body.  If one transfers himself and his soul transmigrates to the moon by this yogic process, he gets a long duration of life. On the higher planets, six of our months equal one day. Thus the beings there live for ten thousand years. That is the description in the Vedic literature. So undoubtedly one can get a very long duration of life, but still there is death. After ten thousand or twenty thousand years, or even after millions of years (it does not matter), death comes.  Actually, we are not subject to death. That is affirmed in the beginning of Bhagavad-gītā (2.20): na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre. We are spirit soul, and therefore we are eternal. Why then should we subject ourselves to death and birth? It is intelligent to think in this way. Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious are very intelligent because they are not interested in getting promotion to any planet where there is death, despite a long duration of life there. Rather, they want to get a body like God's. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. (Bs. 5.1) God's body is sac-cid-ānanda. Sat means \"eternal,\" and cit means \"full of knowledge.\" Ānanda means \"full of pleasure.\""
    }, {
      "text" : "As stated in our pamphlet Kṛṣṇa, the Reservoir of Pleasure, if we transfer ourselves to the spiritual world, to Kṛṣṇa's planet or to any other spiritual planet, then we will get a body similar to God's: sac-cid-ānanda—eternal, full of knowledge and full of bliss. So those who try to be Kṛṣṇa conscious have a different aim of life than those who are trying to promote themselves to the better planets in this material world. Lord Kṛṣṇa says, mūrdhny ādhāyātmanaḥ prāṇam āsthito yoga-dhāraṇām: \"The perfection of yoga is to transfer oneself to the spiritual world.\" (Bg. 8.12)  The spirit soul is a minute particle within the body. We cannot see it. One practices the yoga system to raise the soul to the topmost part of the head. This practice goes on while one is living, and the perfection is reached when one can place himself on the top of the head and then break through. Then he can transfer himself to whatever higher planets he likes. That is the perfection of the yogī.  If the yogī is inquisitive to see the moon, he can say, \"Ah, let me see what the moon is like. Then I shall transfer myself to higher planets,\" just like travelers who go to Europe, California, Canada, or other countries on earth. One can transfer oneself to many planets by this yoga system, but anywhere he goes he will find visa systems and customs systems. To go to other planets, one must be qualified.  Kṛṣṇa conscious persons are not interested in any temporary planet, even if it offers a long duration of life. If the yogī, at the time of death, can pronounce oṁ, the concise form of transcendental vibration, and at the same time mām anusmaran, remember Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, he will attain perfection. The purpose of the entire yoga system is to concentrate the mind on Viṣṇu. Impersonalists imagine that they see the form of Viṣṇu, or the Lord, but those who are personalists do not imagine this—they actually see the form of the Supreme Lord. Either way, if one concentrates his mind through imagination or if one actually sees, one has to concentrate his mind on the Viṣṇu form. Mām means \"unto the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu.\" Anyone who leaves this body and concentrates his mind on Viṣṇu enters into the spiritual kingdom after quitting his body. Those who are actually yogīs do not desire to enter any other planet because they know that life is temporary on the temporary planets, and thus they are not interested. That is intelligence."

      "text" : "Those who are satisfied with temporary happiness, temporary life and temporary facilities are not intelligent according to Bhagavad-gītā (7.23). Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām: \"One whose brain substance is very meager is interested in temporary things.\" That is the version of Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā. I am eternal, so why should I be interested in nonpermanent things? Who wants nonpermanent existence? No one wants it. If we are living in an apartment and the landlord asks us to vacate, we are sorry, but we are not sorry if we move to a better apartment. This then is our inclination. We do not wish to die, because we are eternal.  The material atmosphere is robbing us of our eternality. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam says, \"Our duration of life is being diminished by the sun, beginning from its rising until the time it sets.\" Daily we are losing the duration of our lives. If the sun rises at 5:30 in the morning, at 5:30 in the evening twelve hours have been taken away from the duration of our lives. We will never get this time back. If we ask any scientist, \"I will give you twelve million dollars—please give me back these twelve hours,\" he will reply, \"No, it is not possible.\" The scientist cannot do it. Therefore the Bhāgavatam says that from sunrise to sunset the duration of our lives is being diminished.  Time is called kāla—past, present and future. What is now present, tomorrow will be past, and what is now future, tomorrow will be present. But this past, present and future are the past, present and future of the body. We do not belong to the category of the past, present and future. We belong to the category of eternity. Therefore one should be concerned with how to attain or how to be elevated to the platform of eternity. The developed consciousness of the human being should be utilized not in the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, mating and defending but in searching out the valuable path which will help him get that life of eternity. It is said that the sun is taking away our duration of life—every minute, every hour, every day—but if we engage ourselves in the topics of Uttama-śloka, the topics of the Lord, that time cannot be taken away. The time one devotes in a Kṛṣṇa consciousness temple cannot be taken away. It is an asset—a plus, not a minus. The duration of life, so far as the body is concerned, may be taken; however one tries to keep it intact, no one can do it. But the spiritual education we receive in Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be taken away by the sun. It becomes a solid asset."

Time spent chanting cannot be taken away like time pertaining to the body. Fifty years ago I was a young man, but that time has been taken and cannot be returned. The spiritual knowledge I received from my spiritual master, however, cannot be taken away, but will go with me. Even after I quit this body, it will go with me; and if it is perfect in this life, then it will take me to the eternal abode.  Both the material and spiritual worlds belong to Kṛṣṇa. We are not proprietors of anything. It is all the property of the Supreme Lord, just as everything in the state belongs to the government, either in the prison house or outside the prison house. Conditioned life is just like life in a prison house in this material world. A prisoner cannot freely change from one cell to another. In free life one can go from one home to another home, but in prison life one cannot do that but must stay in his cell. All these planets are like cells. We are trying to go to the moon, but it is not practical by mechanical means. Whether we are American, Indian, Chinese or Russian, we have been given this planet to live on. We cannot leave—although there are millions and billions of planets and although we have machines by which we can—because we are conditioned by the laws of nature, God's laws. A man who is put into a certain cell cannot change at will without superior authority. Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā that one should not try to change from one cell to another. That will not make anyone happy. If a prisoner thinks, \"I am in this cell—let me request the warden to change my cell, and I will be happy,\" that is a mistaken idea. One cannot be happy so long as he is within the prison walls. We are trying to be happy by changing cells—from capitalism to communism. The aim should be to become free from this \"ism\" and that \"ism.\" One has to change completely from this \"ism\" of materialism; then he can become happy. That is the program of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  We are taking advice from the Supreme Person. He says, \"My dear Arjuna, you may be elevated to the highest planetary system, which is called Brahmaloka and is desirable because life there is very long.\" We cannot calculate even a half-day there. It is beyond our mathematical calculations. But even in Brahmaloka there is death. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, \"Do not waste your time trying to elevate yourself or transfer yourself from this planet to that planet.\""

That restlessness is there because we are searching after our real home. To go from this place to that place will not give eternal life. Eternal life is with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, \"Everything belongs to Me, and I have the superexcellent abode, which is called Goloka Vṛndāvana.\" If one wants to go there, he must simply become Kṛṣṇa conscious and try to understand how Kṛṣṇa appears and disappears, what His constitutional position is, what our constitutional position is, what our relationship with Him is, and how to live. Simply try to understand these ideas scientifically. Everything in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is scientific. It is not bogus, whimsical, sentimental, fanatical or imaginary. It is truth, fact, reality. One must understand Kṛṣṇa in truth.  We have to give up this body, willingly or unwillingly. The day will come when we will have to submit to the laws of nature and give up this body. Even President Kennedy in his procession had to submit to nature's law and change his body for another body. He could not say, \"Oh, I am the President; I am Mr. Kennedy. I cannot do that.\" He was forced to do it. That is the way nature works.  The purpose of our developed human consciousness is to understand how nature works. Aside from human consciousness, there is consciousness in dogs, cats, worms, trees, birds, beasts and all other species. But we are not meant to live in that consciousness. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam says that after many, many births we have attained the human form of body. Now we should not misuse it. Please utilize this human life to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness and be happy."

In the Bhagavad-gītā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, teaches Arjuna directly the perfection of yoga. If we actually want to participate in the perfection of the yoga system, in Bhagavad-gītā we will find the authoritative statements of the Supreme Person.  It is certainly remarkable that the perfection of yoga was taught in the middle of a battlefield. It was taught to Arjuna, the warrior, just before Arjuna was to engage in a fratricidal battle. Out of sentiment, Arjuna was thinking, \"Why should I fight against my own kinsmen?\" That reluctance to fight was due to Arjuna's illusion, and just to eradicate that illusion, Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to him. One can just imagine how little time must have elapsed while Bhagavad-gītā was being spoken. All the warriors on both sides were poised to fight, so there was very little time indeed—at the utmost, one hour. Within this one hour, the whole Bhagavad-gītā was discussed, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa set forth the perfection of all yoga systems to His friend Arjuna. At the end of this great discourse, Arjuna set aside his misgivings and fought.  However, within the discourse, when Arjuna heard the explanation of the meditational system of yoga—how to sit down, how to keep the body straight, how to keep the eyes half-closed and how to gaze at the tip of the nose without diverting one's attention, all this being conducted in a secluded place, alone—he replied,  yo 'yaṁ yogas tvayā proktaḥ sāmyena madhusūdana etasyāhaṁ na paśyāmi cañcalatvāt sthitiṁ sthirām  This is important. We must always remember that we are in a material circumstance wherein at every moment our mind is subject to agitation. Actually we are not in a very comfortable situation. We are always thinking that by changing our situation we will overcome our mental agitation, and we are always thinking that when we reach a certain point, all mental agitations will disappear. But it is the nature of the material world that we cannot be free from anxiety. Our dilemma is that we are always trying to make a solution to our problems, but this universe is so designed that these solutions never come."
    }, {
      "text" : "Not being a cheater, being very frank and open, Arjuna tells Kṛṣṇa that the system of yoga which He has described is not possible for him to execute. In speaking to Kṛṣṇa, it is significant that Arjuna addresses Him as Madhusūdana, indicating that the Lord is the killer of the demon Madhu. It is notable that God's names are innumerable, for He is often named according to His activities. Indeed, God has innumerable names because He has innumerable activities. We are only parts of God, and we cannot even remember how many activities we have engaged in from our childhood to the present. The eternal God is unlimited, and since His activities are also unlimited, He has unlimited names, of which Kṛṣṇa is the chief. Then why is Arjuna addressing Him as Madhusūdana when, being Kṛṣṇa's friend, he could address Him directly as Kṛṣṇa? The answer is that Arjuna considers his mind to be like a great demon, such as the demon Madhu. If it were possible for Kṛṣṇa to kill the demon called the mind, then Arjuna would be able to attain the perfection of yoga. \"My mind is much stronger than this demon Madhu,\" Arjuna is saying. \"Please, if You could kill him, then it would be possible for me to execute this yoga system.\" Even the mind of a great man like Arjuna is always agitated. As Arjuna himself says,  cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa pramāthi balavad dṛḍham tasyāhaṁ nigrahaṁ manye vāyor iva suduṣkaram  It is indeed a fact that the mind is always telling us to go here, go there, do this, do that—it is always telling us which way to turn. Thus the sum and substance of the yoga system is to control the agitated mind. In the meditational yoga system the mind is controlled by focusing on the Supersoul—that is the whole purpose of yoga. But Arjuna says that controlling this mind is more difficult than stopping the wind from blowing. One can imagine a man stretching out his arms trying to stop a hurricane. Are we to assume that Arjuna is simply not sufficiently qualified to control his mind? The actual fact is that we cannot begin to understand the immense qualifications of Arjuna. After all, he was a personal friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is a highly elevated position and is one that cannot be at all attained by one without great qualifications. In addition to this, Arjuna was renowned as a great warrior and administrator. He was such an intelligent man that he could understand Bhagavad-gītā within one hour, whereas at the present moment great scholars cannot even understand it in the course of a lifetime. Yet Arjuna was thinking that controlling the mind was simply not possible for him. Are we then to assume that what was impossible for Arjuna in a more advanced age is possible for us in this degenerate age? We should not for one moment think that we are in Arjuna's category. We are a thousand times inferior."
    }, {
      "text" : "Moreover, there is no record of Arjuna's having executed the yoga system at any time. Yet Arjuna was praised by Kṛṣṇa as the only man worthy of understanding Bhagavad-gītā. What was Arjuna's great qualification? Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, \"You are My devotee. You are My very dear friend.\" Despite this qualification, Arjuna refused to execute the meditational yoga system described by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. What then are we to conclude? Are we to despair the mind's ever being controlled? No, it can be controlled, and the process is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The mind must be fixed always in Kṛṣṇa. Insofar as the mind is absorbed in Kṛṣṇa, it has attained the perfection of yoga.  Now when we turn to the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, in the Twelfth Canto we find Śukadeva Gosvāmī telling Mahārāja Parīkṣit that in the golden age, the Satya-yuga, people were living for one hundred thousand years, and at that time, when advanced living entities lived for such lengths of time, it was possible to execute this meditational system of yoga. But what was achieved in the Satya-yuga by this meditational process, and in the following yuga, the Tretā-yuga, by the offering of great sacrifices, and in the next yuga, the Dvāpara-yuga, by temple worship, would be achieved at the present time, in this Kali-yuga, by simply chanting the names of God, hari-kīrtana, Hare Kṛṣṇa. So from authoritative sources we learn that this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare is the embodiment of the perfection of yoga for this age.  Today we have great difficulties living fifty or sixty years. A man may live at the utmost eighty or a hundred years. In addition, these brief years are always fraught with anxiety, with difficulties due to circumstances of war, pestilence, famine and so many other disturbances. We're also not very intelligent, and, at the same time, we're unfortunate. These are the characteristics of man living in Kali-yuga, a degraded age. So properly speaking, we can never attain success in this meditational yoga system described by Kṛṣṇa. At the utmost we can only gratify our personal whims by some pseudoadaptation of this system. Thus people are paying money to attend some classes in gymnastic exercises and deep-breathing, and they're happy if they think they can lengthen their lifetimes by a few years or enjoy better sex life. But we must understand that this is not the actual yoga system. In this age that meditational system cannot be properly executed. Instead, all of the perfections of that system can be realized through bhakti-yoga, the sublime process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, specifically mantra-yoga, the glorification of Śrī Kṛṣṇa through the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is recommended in Vedic scriptures and is introduced by great authorities like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Indeed, the Bhagavad-gītā proclaims that the mahātmās, the great souls, are always chanting the glories of the Lord. If one wants to be a mahātmā in terms of the Vedic literature, in terms of Bhagavad-gītā and in terms of the great authorities, then one has to adopt this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. But if we're content at making a show of meditation by sitting very straight in lotus position and going into a trance like some sort of performer, then that is a different thing. But we should understand that such show-bottle performances have nothing to do with the actual perfection of yoga. The material disease cannot be cured by artificial medicine. We have to take the real cure straight from Kṛṣṇa."

      "text" : "We have heard the names of so many different yogas and yogīs, but in Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa says that the actual yogī is he who has surrendered himself \"fully unto Me.\" Kṛṣṇa proclaims that there is no difference between renunciation (sannyāsa) and yoga.  yaṁ sannyāsam iti prāhur yogaṁ taṁ viddhi pāṇḍava na hy asannyasta-saṅkalpo yogī bhavati kaścana  In Bhagavad-gītā there are three basic types of yoga delineated—karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The systems of yoga may be likened to a staircase. Someone may be on the first step, someone may be halfway up, or someone may be on the top step. When one is elevated to certain levels, he is known as a karma-yogī, jñāna-yogī, etc. In all cases, the service to the Supreme Lord is the same. It is a difference in elevation only. Thus Śrī Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that he must understand that renunciation (sannyāsa) and yoga are the same, because without being freed from desire and sense gratification one can become neither a yogī nor a sannyāsī.  There are some yogīs who perform yoga for a profit, but that is not real yoga. Everything must be engaged in the service of the Lord. Whatever we do as an ordinary worker or as a sannyāsī or as a yogī or as a philosopher must be done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When we are absorbed in the thought of serving Kṛṣṇa and when we act in that consciousness, we can become real sannyāsīs and real yogīs. for those who are taking the first step up the staircase of the yoga system, there is work. One should not think that simply because he is beginning yoga he should stop working. In Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa asks Arjuna to become a yogī, but He never tells him to cease from fighting. Quite the contrary. Of course, one may ask how a person may be a yogī and at the same time a warrior. Our conception of yoga practice is that of sitting very straight, with legs crossed and eyes half-closed, staring at the tip of our nose and concentrating in this way in a lonely place. So how is it that Kṛṣṇa is asking Arjuna to become a yogī and at the same time participate in a ghastly civil war? That is the mystery of Bhagavad-gītā: one can remain a fighting man and at the same time be the highest yogī, the highest sannyāsī. How is this possible? In Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One simply has to fight for Kṛṣṇa, work for Kṛṣṇa, eat for Kṛṣṇa, sleep for Kṛṣṇa and dedicate all activities to Kṛṣṇa. In this way one becomes the highest yogī and the highest sannyāsī. That is the secret."

Although Kṛṣṇa saw that Arjuna was rejecting the meditational system, He proclaimed Arjuna to be the highest yogī because \"You are always thinking of Me.\" Thinking of Kṛṣṇa is the essence of all yoga systems—of the haṭha, karma, jñāna, bhakti or any other system of yoga, sacrifice or charity. All the recommended activities for spiritual realization end in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in thinking always of Kṛṣṇa. The actual perfection of human life lies in being always Kṛṣṇa conscious and always being aware of Kṛṣṇa while performing all types of activities.  In the preliminary stage one is advised to always work for Kṛṣṇa. One must be always searching out some duty or some engagement, for it is a bad policy to remain idle even for a second. When one actually becomes advanced through such engagements, then he may not work physically, but he is always engaged within by constantly thinking of Kṛṣṇa. In the preliminary stage, however, one is always advised to engage one's senses in the service of Kṛṣṇa. There are a variety of activities one can perform in serving Kṛṣṇa. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is intended to help direct aspirant devotees in these activities. for those working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there are simply not enough hours in the day to serve Kṛṣṇa. There are always activities, engagements both day and night, which the student of Kṛṣṇa consciousness performs joyfully. That is the stage of real happiness—constant engagement for Kṛṣṇa and spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness around the world. In the material world one may become very tired if he works all the time, but if one works in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day and never get tired. But if we vibrate some mundane vibration, then we soon become exhausted. There is no question of becoming tired on the spiritual platform. The spiritual platform is absolute. In the material world everyone is working for sense gratification. The profits of one's labor in the material world are used to gratify one's senses. But a real yogī does not desire such fruits. He has no desire other than Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is already there."

      "text" : "In India there are sacred places where yogīs go to meditate in solitude, as prescribed in Bhagavad-gītā. Traditionally, yoga cannot be executed in a public place, but insofar as kīrtana-mantra-yoga, or the yoga of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare—is concerned, the more people present, the better. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was performing kīrtana in India some five hundred years ago, He organized in each group sixteen people to lead the chanting, and thousands of people chanted with them. This participation in kīrtana, in the public chanting of the names and glories of God, is very possible and is actually easy in this age; but as far as the meditational process of yoga is concerned, that is very difficult. It is specifically stated in Bhagavad-gītā that to perform meditational yoga one should go to a secluded and holy place. In other words, it is necessary to leave home. In this age of overpopulation it is not always possible to find a secluded place, but this is not necessary in bhakti-yoga.  In the bhakti-yoga system there are nine different processes: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping the Deity in the temple, praying, carrying out orders, serving Kṛṣṇa as a friend and sacrificing for Him. Out of these, śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam [SB 7.5.23], hearing and chanting, are considered the most important. At a public kīrtana one person can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, while a group listens, and at the end of the mantra, the group can respond, and in this way there is a reciprocation of hearing and chanting. This can easily be performed in one's own home, with a small group of friends or with many people in a large public place. One may attempt to practice meditational yoga in a large city or in a society, but one must understand that this is one's own concoction and is not the method recommended in Bhagavad-gītā.  The whole process of the yoga system is to purify oneself. And what is this purification? Purification ensues upon the realization of one's actual identity. Purification is realizing that \"I am pure spirit—I am not this matter.\" Due to material contact, we are identifying ourselves with matter, and we are thinking, \"I am this body.\" But in order to perform real yoga one must realize his constitutional position as being distinct from matter. The purpose of seeking out a secluded place and executing the meditational process is to come to this understanding. It is not possible to come to this understanding if one executes the process improperly. "

      "text" : "In any case, this is the consideration of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu:  harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā [Cc. Ādi 17.21]  It is generally thought, at least in the Western world, that the yoga system involves meditating on the void. But the Vedic literatures do not recommend meditating on any void. Rather, the Vedas maintain that yoga means meditation on Viṣṇu, and this is also maintained in Bhagavad-gītā. In many yoga societies we find that people sit cross-legged and very straight, then close their eyes to meditate, and so fifty percent of them go to sleep, because when we close our eyes and have no subject matter for contemplation, we simply go to sleep. Of course, this is not recommended by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad-gītā. One must sit very straight, and the eyes be only half-closed, gazing at the tip of one's nose. If one does not follow the instructions, the result will be sleep and nothing more. Sometimes, of course, meditation goes on when one is sleeping, but this is not the recommended process for the execution of yoga. Thus, to keep oneself awake Kṛṣṇa advises that one always keep the tip of the nose visible. In addition, one must be always undisturbed. If the mind is agitated or if there is a great deal of activity going on, one will not be able to concentrate. In meditational yoga one must also be devoid of fear. There is no question of fear when one enters spiritual life. And one must also be brahmacārī, completely free from sex life. Nor can there be any demands on one meditating in this way. When there are no demands, and one executes this system properly, then he can control his mind. After one has met all the requirements for meditation, he must transfer his whole thought to Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu. It is not that one is to transfer his thought to vacancy. Thus Kṛṣṇa says that one absorbed in the meditational yoga system is \"always thinking of Me.\"  The yogī obviously has to go through a great deal of difficulty to purify the ātmā (mind, body and soul), but it is a fact that this can be done most effectively in this age simply by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Why is this? Because this transcendental sound vibration is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. When we chant His name with devotion, then Kṛṣṇa is with us, and when Kṛṣṇa is with us, then what is the possibility of remaining impure? Consequently, one absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in chanting the names of Kṛṣṇa and serving Him always, receives the benefit of the highest form of yoga. The advantage is that he doesn't have to take all the trouble of the meditational process. That is the beauty of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

One becomes peaceful after thus conquering material life.  jitātmanaḥ praśāntasya paramātmā samāhitaḥ  This material world has been likened to a great forest fire. As in the forest, fire may automatically take place, so in this material world, although we may try to live peacefully, there is always a great conflagration. It is not possible to live in peace anywhere in the material world. But for one who is transcendentally situated—either by the meditational yoga system or by the empirical philosophical method or by bhakti-yoga—peace is possible. All forms of yoga are meant for transcendental life, but the method of chanting is especially effective in this age. Kīrtana may go on for hours, and one may not feel tired, but it is difficult to sit in lotus position perfectly still for more than a few minutes. Yet regardless of the process, once the fire of material life is extinguished, one does not simply experience what is called impersonal void. Rather, as Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna, one enters into the supreme abode.  yuñjann evaṁ sadātmānaṁ yogī niyata-mānasaḥ śāntiṁ nirvāṇa-paramāṁ mat-saṁsthām adhigacchati  Kṛṣṇa's abode is not void. It is like an establishment, and in an establishment there is a variety of engagements. The successful yogī actually attains to the kingdom of God, where there is spiritual variegatedness. The yoga processes are simply ways to elevate oneself to enter into that abode. Actually we belong to that abode, but being forgetful, we are put in this material world. Just as a madman becomes crazy and is put into a lunatic asylum, so we, losing sight of our spiritual identity, become crazy and are put into this material world. Thus the material world is a sort of lunatic asylum, and we can easily notice that nothing is done very sanely here. Our real business is to get out and enter into the kingdom of God. In Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa gives information of this kingdom and also gives instructions about His position and our position—of what He is and what we are. All the information necessary is set forth in Bhagavad-gītā, and a sane man will take advantage of this knowledge."

      "text" : "Throughout Bhagavad-gītā, Kṛṣṇa was encouraging Arjuna to fight, for he was a warrior, and fighting was his duty. Although Kṛṣṇa delineates the meditational yoga system in the Sixth Chapter, He does not stress it or encourage Arjuna to pursue it as his path. Kṛṣṇa admits that this meditational process is very difficult:  śrī-bhaga vān uvāca asaṁśayaṁ mahā-bāho mano durnigrahaṁ calam abhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyeṇa ca gṛhyate  Here Kṛṣṇa emphasizes practice and renunciation as ways to control the mind. But what is that renunciation? Today it is hardly possible for us to renounce anything, for we are so habituated to such a variety of material sense pleasures. Despite leading a life of uncontrolled sense indulgence, we attend yoga classes and expect to attain success. There are so many rules and regulations involved in the proper execution of yoga, and most of us can hardly give up a simple habit like smoking. In His discourse on the meditational yoga system, Kṛṣṇa proclaims that yoga cannot be properly performed by one who eats too much or eats too little. One who starves himself cannot properly perform yoga. Nor can the person who eats more than required. The eating process should be moderate, just enough to keep body and soul together; it should not be for the enjoyment of the tongue. When palatable dishes come before us, we are accustomed to take not just one of the preparations but two, three and four—and upwards. Our tongue is never satisfied. But it is not unusual in India to see a yogī take only a small spoonful of rice a day and nothing more. Nor can one execute the meditational yoga system if one sleeps too much or does not sleep sufficiently. Kṛṣṇa does not say that there is such a thing as dreamless sleep. As soon as we go to sleep, we will have a dream, although we may not remember it. In the Gītā Kṛṣṇa cautions that one who dreams too much while sleeping cannot properly execute yoga. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. Nor can one infected by insomnia, who cannot sleep at night, successfully execute yoga, for the body must be kept fit. Thus Kṛṣṇa outlines so many requirements for disciplining the body. All these requirements, however, can essentially be broken down into four basic rules: no illicit sexual connection, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. These are the four minimum regulations for the execution of any yoga system. And in this age who can refrain from these activities? We have to test ourselves accordingly to ascertain our success in yoga execution."

      "text" : "yogī yuñjīta satatam ātmānaṁ rahasi sthitaḥ ekākī yata-cittātmā nirāśīr aparigrahaḥ  From this verse we can understand that it is the duty of the yogī to always remain alone. Meditational yoga cannot be performed in an assembly, at least not according to Bhagavad-gītā. In the meditational system it is not possible to concentrate the mind upon the Supersoul except in a secluded place. In India, there are still many yogīs who assemble at the Kumba Melā. Generally they are in seclusion, but on rare occasions they come to attend special functions. In India there are still thousands of yogīs and sages, and every twelve years or so they meet in particular holy places—Allahabad, etc.—just as in America they have businessmen's conventions. The yogī, in addition to living in a secluded place, should also be free from desires and should not think that he is performing yoga to achieve some material powers. Nor should he accept gifts or favors from people. If he is properly executing this meditational yoga, he stays alone in the jungles, forests or mountains and avoids society altogether. At all times he must be convinced for whom he has become a yogī. He does not consider himself alone because at all times the Paramātmā—Supersoul—is with him. from this we can see that in modern civilization it is indeed very difficult to execute this meditational form of yoga properly. Contemporary civilization in this age of Kali has actually made it impossible for us to be alone, to be desireless and to be possessionless.  The method of executing meditational yoga is further explained in considerable detail by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says,  śucau deśe pratiṣṭhāpya sthiram āsanam ātmanaḥ nāty-ucchritaṁ nāti-nīcaṁ cailājina-kuśottaram  tatraikāgraṁ manaḥ kṛtvā yata-cittendriya-kriyaḥ upaviśyāsane yuñjyād yogam ātma-viśuddhaye"

      "text" : "Generally yogīs sit on tigerskin or deerskin because reptiles will not crawl on such skins to disturb their meditations. It seems that in God's creation there is a use for everything. Every grass and herb has its use and serves some function, although we may not know what it is. So in Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa has made some provision whereby the yogī doesn't have to worry about snakes. Having acquired a good sitting place in a secluded environment, the yogī begins to purify the ātmā—body, mind and soul. The yogī should not think, \"Now I will try to achieve some wonderful powers.\" Sometimes yogīs do attain certain siddhis, or powers, but these are not the purpose of yoga, and real yogīs do not exhibit them. The real yogī thinks, \"I am now contaminated by this material atmosphere, so now I must purify myself.\"  We can quickly see that controlling the mind and body is not such an easy thing and that we cannot control them as easily as we can go to the store and purchase something. But Kṛṣṇa indicates that these rules can be easily followed when we are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  Of course everyone is motivated by sex life, but sex life is not actually discouraged. We have this material body, and as long as we have it, sex desire will be there. Similarly, as long as we have the body, we must eat to maintain it, and we must sleep in order to give it rest. We cannot expect to negate these activities, but the Vedic literatures do give us guidelines for regulation in eating, sleeping, mating, etc. If we at all expect success in the yoga system, we cannot allow our unbridled senses to take us down the paths of sense objects; therefore guidelines are set up. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is advising that the mind can be controlled through regulation. If we do not regulate our activities, our mind will be more and more agitated. It is not that activities are to be stopped, but regulated by the mind always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Being always engaged in some activity connected with Kṛṣṇa is actual samādhi. It is not that when one is in samādhi he doesn't eat, work, sleep or enjoy himself in any way. Rather, samādhi can be defined as executing regulated activities while absorbed in the thought of Kṛṣṇa."

He can go in any direction at any speed, and his rider is likely to come to some harm. Insofar as the mind is unbridled, Kṛṣṇa agrees with Arjuna that the yoga system is very difficult work indeed. \"But,\" Kṛṣṇa adds, \"he whose mind is controlled and strives by right means is assured of success. That is My judgment.\" (Bg. 6.36) What is meant by \"strives by right means\"? One has to try to follow the four basic regulative principles as mentioned and execute his activities absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  If one wants to engage in yoga at home, then he has to make certain that his other engagements are moderate. He cannot spend long hours of the day working hard to simply earn a livelihood. One should work very moderately, eat very moderately, gratify the senses very moderately and keep his life as free from anxiety as possible. In this way practice of yoga may be successful.  What is the sign by which we can tell that one has attained perfection in yoga? Kṛṣṇa indicates that one is situated in yoga when his consciousness is completely under his control.  yadā viniyataṁ cittam ātmany evāvatiṣṭhate nispṛhaḥ sarva-kāmebhyo yukta ity ucyate tadā  One who has attained yoga is not dependent on the dictations of his mind; rather, the mind comes under his control. Nor is the mind put out or extinguished, for it is the business of the yogī to think of Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu, always. The yogī cannot allow his mind to go out. This may sound very difficult, but it is possible in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one is always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the service of Kṛṣṇa, then how is it possible for the mind to wander away from Kṛṣṇa? In the service of Kṛṣṇa, the mind is automatically controlled."

      "text" : "Nor should the yogī have any desire for material sense gratification. If one is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he has no desire other than Kṛṣṇa. It is not possible to become desireless. The desire for sense gratification must be overcome by the process of purification, but desire for Kṛṣṇa should be cultivated. It is simply that we have to transfer the desire. There is no question of killing desire, for desire is the constant companion of the living entity. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the process by which one purifies his desires; instead of desiring so many things for sense gratification, one simply desires things for the service of Kṛṣṇa. for example, we may desire palatable food, but instead of preparing foodstuffs for ourselves, we can prepare them for Kṛṣṇa and offer them to Him. It is not that the action is different, but there is a transfer of consciousness from thinking of acting for my senses to thinking of acting for Kṛṣṇa. We may prepare nice milk products, vegetables, grains, fruits and other vegetarian dishes for Kṛṣṇa and then offer them to Him, praying, \"This material body is a lump of ignorance and the senses are a network of paths leading to death. Of all the senses the tongue is the most voracious and difficult to control. It is very difficult to conquer the tongue in this world; therefore Śrī Kṛṣṇa has given us this nice prasāda, spiritual food, to conquer the tongue. So let us take this prasāda to our full satisfaction and glorify Their Lordships Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and in love call for the help of Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda Prabhu.\" In this way our karma is sacrificed, for from the very beginning we are thinking that the food is being offered to Kṛṣṇa. We should have no personal desires for the food. Kṛṣṇa is so merciful, however, that he gives us the food to eat. In this way our desire is fulfilled. When one has molded his life in such a way—dovetailing his desires to Kṛṣṇa's—then it is to be understood that he has attained perfection in yoga. Simply breathing deeply and doing some exercises is not yoga as far as Bhagavad-gītā is concerned. A whole purification of consciousness is required.  In the execution of yoga, it is very important that the mind is not agitated.  yathā dīpo nivāta-stho neṅgate sopamā smṛtā yogino yata-cittasya yuñjato yogam ātmanaḥ  When a candle is in a windless place, its flame remains straight and does not waver. The mind, like the flame, is susceptible to so many material desires that with the slightest agitation it will move. A little movement of the mind can change the whole consciousness. Therefore in India one seriously practicing yoga traditionally remained brahmacārī, or celibate. There are two kinds of brahmacārī: one is completely celibate and the other is gṛhastha-brahmacārī, that is to say he has a wife, he does not associate with any other woman, and his relations with his own wife are strictly regulated. In this way, either by complete celibacy or restricted sex life, one's mind is kept from being agitated. Yet when one takes a vow to remain a complete celibate, his mind may still be agitated by sexual desire; therefore in India those practicing the traditional yoga under strict vows of celibacy are not allowed to sit alone even with a mother, sister or daughter. The mind is so fickle that the slightest suggestion can create havoc."

      "text" : "The yogī should have his mind trained in such a way that as soon as his mind wanders from meditation on Viṣṇu, he drags it back again. This requires a great deal of practice. One must come to know that his real happiness is in experiencing the pleasure of his transcendental senses, not the material senses. Senses are not to be sacrificed, and desires are not to be sacrificed, but there are both desires and sense satisfaction in the spiritual sphere. Real happiness is transcendental to material, sensual experience. If one is not convinced of this, he will surely be agitated and will fall down. One should therefore know that the happiness he is trying to derive from material senses is not really happiness.  Those who are actually yogīs truly enjoy, but how do they enjoy? Ramante yogino 'nante—their enjoyment is unlimited, that unlimited enjoyment is real happiness, and such happiness is spiritual, not material. This is the real meaning of Rāma, as in the chant Hare Rāma. Rāma means enjoyment through spiritual life. Spiritual life is all pleasure, and Kṛṣṇa is all pleasure. We do not have to sacrifice pleasure, but we do have to enjoy it properly. A diseased man cannot enjoy life; his enjoyment of life is a false enjoyment. But when he is cured and is healthy, then he is able to enjoy. Similarly, as long as we are in the material conception of life, we are not actually enjoying ourselves but are simply becoming more and more entangled in material nature. If a sick man is not supposed to eat, his eating unrestrictedly actually kills him. Similarly, the more we increase material enjoyment, the more we become entangled in this world, and the more difficult it becomes to get free from the material entrapment. All of the systems of yoga are meant to disentangle the conditioned soul from this entrapment, to transfer him from the false enjoyment of material things to the actual enjoyment of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says,  yatroparamate cittaṁ niruddhaṁ yoga-sevayā yatra caivātmanātmānaṁ paśyann ātmani tuṣyati  sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad buddhi-grāhyam atīndriyam vetti yatra na caivāyaṁ sthitaś calati tattvataḥ"

It is only by behavior that one can understand who is his friend and who is his enemy.\" No one is born our enemy, and no one is born our friend. These roles are determined by mutual behavior. As we have dealings with others in ordinary affairs, in the same way the individual has dealings with himself. I may act as my own friend or as an enemy. As a friend, I can understand my position as spirit soul and, seeing that somehow or other I have come into contact with material nature, try to get free from material entanglement by acting in such a way as to disentangle myself. In this case I am my friend. But if even after getting this opportunity I do not take it, then I should be considered my own worst enemy."

      "text" : "bandhur ātmātmanas tasya yenātmaivātmanā jitaḥ anātmanas tu śatrutve vartetātmaiva śatru-vat  How is it possible for one to become his own friend? This is explained here. Ātmā means \"mind,\" \"body\" and \"soul.\" When we speak of ātmā, insofar as we are in the bodily conception, we refer to the body. However, when we transcend the bodily conception and rise to the mental platform, ātmā refers to the mind. But actually when we are situated on the truly spiritual platform, then ātmā refers to the soul. In actuality we are pure spirit. In this way, according to one's spiritual development, the meaning of the word ātmā differs. As far as the Nirukti Vedic dictionary is concerned, ātmā refers to body, mind and soul. However, in this verse of Bhagavad-gītā, ātmā refers to mind.  If, through yoga, the mind can be trained, then the mind is our friend. But if the mind is left untrained, then there is no possibility of leading a successful life. for one who has no idea of spiritual life, the mind is the enemy. If one thinks that he is simply the body, his mind will not be working for his benefit; it will simply be acting to serve the gross body and to further condition the living entity and entrap him in material nature. If, however, one understands one's position as spirit soul apart from the body, the mind can be a liberating factor. In itself, the mind has nothing to do; it is simply waiting to be trained, and it is best trained through association. Desire is the function of the mind, and one desires according to his association; so if the mind is to act as friend, there must be good association.  The best association is a sādhu, that is, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person or one who is striving for spiritual realization. There are those who are striving for temporary things (asat). Matter and the body are temporary, and if one only engages himself for bodily pleasure, he is conditioned by temporary things. But if he engages himself in self-realization, then he is engaged in something permanent (sat). Obviously if one is intelligent he will associate with those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of self-realization through one of the various forms of yoga. The result will be that those who are sādhu, or realized, will be able to sever his attachment to material association. This is the great advantage of good association. for instance, Kṛṣṇa speaks Bhagavad-gītā to Arjuna just to cut off his attachment to this material affection. Because Arjuna is attracted to things that are impeding the execution of his own duty, Kṛṣṇa severs these things. To cut something, a sharp instrument is required; and to cut the mind from its attachments, sharp words are often required. The sādhu or teacher shows no mercy in using sharp words to sever the student's mind from material attractions. By speaking the truth uncompromisingly, he is able to sever the bondage. for example, at the very beginning of Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa speaks sharply to Arjuna by telling him that although he speaks like a learned man, he is actually fool number one. If we actually want detachment from this material world, we should be prepared to accept such cutting words from the spiritual master. Compromise and flattery have no effect where strong words are required."

Conditioned souls struggle very hard with the mind and with the other senses.

Although we are permanent and eternal, somehow or other we have become attracted to nonpermanent things. But the mind can be easily trained if it is simply fixed on Kṛṣṇa. Just as a fort is safe when it is defended by a great general, if Kṛṣṇa is placed in the fort of the mind, there will be no possibility of the enemy's entering. Material education, wealth and power will not help one to control the mind. A great devotee prays, ' 'When will I be able to think of You constantly? My mind is always dragging me about, but as soon as I am able to fix my mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, it becomes clear.\" When the mind is clear, it is possible to meditate on the Supersoul. The Paramātmā, or Supersoul, is always seated within the heart along with the individual soul. The yoga system involves concentrating the mind and focusing it on the Paramātmā, or Supersoul, seated within the heart. The previously quoted verse from Bhagavad-gītā indicates that one who has conquered the mind and has overcome all attachment to nonpermanent things can be absorbed in thought of the Paramātmā. One so absorbed becomes free from all duality and false designations."

Or at one moment we're happy and at the next moment distressed. At one moment honored, at the next dishonored. In the material world of duality, it is impossible to understand one thing without understanding its opposite. It is not possible to understand what honor is unless I understand dishonor. Similarly, I cannot understand what misery is if I have never tasted happiness. Nor can I understand what happiness is unless I have tasted misery. One has to transcend such dualities, but as long as this body is here these dualities will be here also. Insofar as one strives to get out of bodily conceptions—not out of the body but out of bodily conceptions—one has to learn to tolerate such dualities. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa informs Arjuna that the duality of distress and happiness is due to the body alone. It's like a skin disease, or skin itch. Just because there is itching, one should not be mad after it to scratch it. We should not go mad or give up our duty just because mosquitoes bite us. There are so many dualities one has to tolerate, but if the mind is fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all these dualities will seem insignificant.  How is it one can tolerate such dualities?  jñāna-vijñāna-tṛptātmā kūṭa-stho vijitendriyaḥ yukta ity ucyate yogī sama-loṣṭrāśma-kāñcanaḥ  Jñāna means theoretical knowledge, and vijñāna refers to practical knowledge. for instance, a science student has to study theoretical scientific conceptions as well as applied science. Theoretical knowledge alone will not help. One has to be able to also apply this knowledge. Similarly, in yoga one should have not only theoretical knowledge but practical knowledge. Simply understanding \"I am not this body\" and at the same time acting in a nonsensical way will not help. There are so many societies where the members seriously discuss Vedānta philosophy while smoking and drinking and enjoying a sensual life. It will not help if one only has knowledge theoretically. This knowledge must be demonstrated. One who truly understands \"I am not this body\" will actually reduce his bodily necessities to a minimum. When one increases the demands of the body while thinking \"I am not this body,\" then of what use is that knowledge? A person can only be satisfied when there is jñāna and vijñāna side by aide."

      "text" : "When a person is situated on the practical level of spiritual realization, it should be understood he is actually situated in yoga. It is not that one should continue to attend yoga classes and yet remain the same throughout his life; there must be practical realization. And what is the sign of that practical realization? The mind will be calm and quiet and no longer agitated by the attraction of the material world. Thus self-controlled, one is not attracted by the material glitter, and he sees everything—pebbles, stones or gold—as the same. In the material civilization, so much paraphernalia is produced just to satisfy the senses. These things are produced under the banner of material advancement. He who is situated in yoga sees such paraphernalia as just so much rubbish in the street. Moreover,  suhṛn-mitrāry-udāsīna- madhyastha-dveṣya-bandhuṣu sādhuṣv api ca pāpeṣu sama-buddhir viśiṣyate  There are different kinds of friends. There is suhṛt, who is by nature a well-wisher and is always desiring one's welfare. Mitra refers to an ordinary friend, and udāsīna is one who is neutral. In this material world someone may be my well-wisher, friend or neither friend nor enemy but neutral. Someone else may serve as a mediator between me and my enemies, and in this verse he is called madhya-stha One may also see someone as pious and another as sinful according to his own calculations. But when he is situated in transcendence, all of these—friends, enemies or whatever—cease to exist. When one becomes actually learned, he does not see any enemy or any friend because in actuality \"no one is my enemy, no one is my friend, no one is my father, no one is my mother, etc.\" We are all simply living entities playing on a stage in the dress of father, mother, children, friend, enemy, sinner and saint, etc. It is like a great drama with so many characters playing their parts. However, on the stage a person may be an enemy or whatever, but off the stage all the actors are friends. Similarly, with these bodies we are playing on the stage of material nature, and we attach so many designations to one another. I may be thinking, \"This is my son,\" but in actuality I cannot beget any son. It is not possible. At the utmost I can only beget a body. It is not within any man's power to beget a living entity. Merely by sexual intercourse a living entity cannot be begotten. The living entity must be placed in the emulsification of secretions. This is the verdict of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Thus all the multifarious relationships between bodies are just so much stage play. One who is actually realized and has actually attained yoga no longer sees these bodily distinctions."

Arjuna next asks,  ayatiḥ śraddhayopeto yogāc calita-mānasaḥ aprāpya yoga-saṁsiddhiṁ kāṁ gatiṁ kṛṣṇa gacchati  In other words, he is asking what becomes of the unsuccessful yogī, or the person who attempts to perform yoga but somehow desists and does not succeed. It is something like a student who does not get his degree because he drops out of school. Elsewhere in the Gītā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa points out to Arjuna that out of many men, few strive for perfection, and out of those who strive for perfection, only a few succeed. So Arjuna is inquiring after the vast number of failures. Even if a man has faith and strives for perfection in the yoga system, Arjuna points out that he may not attain this perfection due to \"worldly-mindedness.\"  kaccin nobhaya-vibhraṣṭaś chinnābhram iva naśyati apratiṣṭho mahā-bāho vimūḍho brahmaṇaḥ pathi  When a cloud is torn apart by the wind, it does not mend back together again.  etan me saṁśayaṁ kṛṣṇa chettum arhasy aśeṣataḥ tvad-anyaḥ saṁśayasyāsya chettā na hy upapadyate"

      "text" : "Arjuna is asking this question about the fate of the unsuccessful yogī so that in the future people would not be discouraged. By a yogī, Arjuna is referring to the haṭha-yogī, jñāna-yogī and bhakti-yogī; it is not that meditation is the only form of yoga. The meditator, the philosopher and the devotee are all to be considered yogīs. Arjuna is questioning for all those who are attempting to become successful transcendentalists. And how does Śrī Kṛṣṇa answer him?  śrī-bhagavān uvāca pārtha naiveha nāmutra vināśas tasya vidyate na hi kalyāṇa-kṛt kaścid durgatiṁ tāta gacchati  Here, as in many other places throughout the Gītā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is referred to as Bhagavān. This is another of the Lord's innumerable names. Bhagavān indicates that Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of six opulences: He possesses all beauty, all wealth, all power, all fame, all knowledge and all renunciation. Living entities partake of these opulences in finite degrees. One may be famous in a family, in a town, in a country or on one planet, but no one is famous throughout the creation, as is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The leaders of the world may be famous for a few years only, but Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared five thousand years ago and is still being worshiped. So one who possesses all six of these opulences in completeness is considered to be God. In Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa speaks to Arjuna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such it is to be understood that He has complete knowledge. Bhagavad-gītā was imparted to the sun-god and to Arjuna by Kṛṣṇa, but nowhere is it mentioned that Bhagavad-gītā was imparted to Kṛṣṇa. Why? Complete knowledge means that He knows everything that is to be known. This is an attribute of God alone. Being that Kṛṣṇa knows everything, Arjuna is putting this question to Him about the fate of the unsuccessful yogī. There is no possibility for Arjuna to research the truth. He simply has to receive the truth from the complete source, and this is the system of disciplic succession. Kṛṣṇa is complete, and the knowledge that comes from Kṛṣṇa is also complete. If Arjuna receives this complete knowledge and we receive it from Arjuna as it was spoken to him, then we also receive complete knowledge. And what is this knowledge? \"The Blessed Lord said: Son of Pṛthā, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.\" (Bg. 6.40) Here Kṛṣṇa indicates that the very striving for yoga perfection is a most auspicious attempt. When one attempts something so auspicious, he is never degraded."

      "text" : "Actually Arjuna is asking a very appropriate and intelligent question. It is not unusual for one to fall down from the platform of devotional service. Sometimes a neophyte devotee does not keep the rules and regulations. Sometimes he yields to intoxication or is trapped by some feminine attractions. These are impediments on the path of yoga perfection. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa gives an encouraging answer, for He tells Arjuna that even if one sincerely cultivates only one-percent worth of spiritual knowledge, he will never fall down into the material whirlpool. That is due to the sincerity of his effort. It should always be understood that we are weak and that the material energy is very strong. To adopt spiritual life is more or less to declare war against the material energy. The material energy is trying to entrap the conditioned soul as much as possible, and when the conditioned soul tries to get out of her clutches by spiritual advancement of knowledge, material nature becomes more stringent and vigorous in her efforts to test how much the aspiring spiritualist is sincere. The material energy, or māyā, will then offer more allurements.  In this regard, there is the story of Viśvāmitra Muni, a great king, a kṣatriya, who renounced his kingdom and took to the yoga process in order to become more spiritually advanced. At that time the meditational yoga process was possible to execute. Viśvāmitra Muni meditated so intently that Indra, the King of heaven, noticed him and thought, ' 'This man is trying to occupy my post.\" The heavenly planets are also material, and there is competition—no businessman wants another businessman to exceed him. fearing that Viśvāmitra Muni would actually depose him, Indra sent one heavenly society girl, named Menakā, to allure him sexually. Menakā was naturally very beautiful, and she was intent on disrupting the muni's meditations. Indeed, he became aware of her feminine presence upon hearing the sound of her bangles, and he immediately looked up from his meditation, saw her, and became captivated by her beauty. As a result, the beautiful girl Śakuntalā was born by their conjugation. When Śakuntalā was born, Viśvāmitra lamented: \"Oh, I was just trying to cultivate spiritual knowledge, and again I have been entrapped.\" He was about to flee when Menakā brought his beautiful daughter before him and chastised him. Despite her pleading, Viśvāmitra resolved to leave anyway.  Thus there is every chance of failure on the yogic path; even a great sage like Viśvāmitra Muni can fall down due to material allurement. Although the muni fell for the time being, he again resolved to go on with the yoga process, and this should be our resolve. Kṛṣṇa informs us that such failures should not be cause for despair. There is the famous proverb that \"failure is the pillar of success.\" In the spiritual life especially, failure is not discouraging. Kṛṣṇa very clearly states that even if there is failure, there is no loss either in this world or in the next. One who takes to this auspicious line of spiritual culture is never completely vanquished."
    }, {
      "text" : "Now what actually happens to the unsuccessful spiritualist? Śrī Kṛṣṇa specifically explains,  prāpya puṇya-kṛtāṁ lokān uṣitvā śāśvatīḥ samāḥ śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate [Bg. 6.41]  athavā yoginām eva kule bhavati dhīmatām etad dhi durlabhataraṁ loke janma yad īdṛśam [Bg. 6.42]  There are many planets in the universe, and on the higher planets there are greater comforts, the duration of life is longer, and the inhabitants are more religious and godly. Since it is said that six months on earth is equal to one day on the higher planets, the unsuccessful yogī stays on these higher planets for many, many years. Vedic literatures describe their lifetimes as lasting ten thousand years. So even if one is a failure, he is promoted to these higher planets. But one cannot remain there perpetually. When the fruits or the results of one's pious activities expire, he has to return to earth. Yet even upon returning to this planet, the unsuccessful yogī meets with fortunate circumstances, for he takes his birth in either a very rich family or a pious one.  Generally, according to the law of karma, if one enacts pious deeds, he is rewarded in the next life by birth into a very aristocratic family or into a very wealthy family, or he becomes a great scholar, or he is born very beautiful. In any case, those who sincerely begin spiritual life are guaranteed human birth in the next life—not only human birth, but birth into either a very pious or a very wealthy family. Thus one with such a good birth should understand that his fortune is due to his previous pious activities and to God's grace. These facilities are given by the Lord, who is always willing to give us the means to attain Him. Kṛṣṇa simply wants to see that we are sincere. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated that every particular person has his own duty in life, regardless of his position and regardless of his society. If, however, he gives up his prescribed duty and somehow—either out of sentiment or association or craziness or whatever—takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa, and if, due to his immaturity, he falls from the devotional path, still there is no loss for him. On the other hand, if a person executes his duties perfectly but does not approach God, then what does he earn? His life is indeed without benefit. But a person who has approached Kṛṣṇa is better situated, even though he may fall down from the yogic platform."
    }, {
      "text" : "Kṛṣṇa further indicates that of all good families to be born into—families of successful merchants or philosophers or meditators—the best is the family of yogīs. One who takes birth in a very rich family may be misled. It is normal for a man who is given great riches to try to enjoy those riches; thus rich men's sons often become drunkards or prostitute hunters. Similarly, one who takes birth in a pious family or in a brahminical family often becomes very puffed up and proud, thinking, \"I am a brāhmaṇa; I am a pious man.\" There is chance of degradation in both rich and pious families, but one who takes birth in a family of yogīs or of devotees has a much better chance of cultivating again that spiritual life from which he has fallen. Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna,  tatra taṁ buddhi-saṁyogaṁ labhate paurva-dehikam yatate ca tato bhūyaḥ saṁsiddhau kuru-nandana  Being born in a family of those who execute yoga or devotional service, one remembers his spiritual activities executed in his previous life. Anyone who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously is not an ordinary person; he must have taken to the same process in his previous life. Why is this?  pūrvābhyāsena tenaiva hriyate hy avaśo 'pi saḥ  In the material world, we have experience that we do not carry our assets from one life to another. I may have millions of dollars in the bank, but as soon as my body is finished, my bank balance is also. At death, the bank balance does not go with me; it remains in the bank to be enjoyed by somebody else. This is not the case with spiritual culture. Even if one enacts a very small amount on the spiritual platform, he takes that with him to his next life, and he picks up again from that point.  When one picks up this knowledge that was interrupted, he should know that he should now finish the balance and complete the yogic process. One should not take the chance of finishing up the process in another birth but should resolve to finish it in this life. We should be determined in this way: \"Somehow or other in my last life, I did not finish my spiritual cultivation. Now Kṛṣṇa has given me another opportunity, so let me finish it up in this life.\" Thus after leaving this body one will not again take birth in this material world, where birth, old age, disease and death are omnipresent, but will return to Kṛṣṇa. One who takes shelter under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa sees this material world simply as a place of danger. For one who takes to spiritual culture, this material world is actually unfit. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī used to say, \"This place is not fit for a gentleman.\" Once one has approached Kṛṣṇa and has attempted to make spiritual progress, Kṛṣṇa, who is situated within the heart, begins to give directions. In the Gītā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that for one who wants to remember Him, He gives remembrance, and for one who wants to forget Him, He allows him to forget."

      "text" : "We have heard many times of the yoga system. The yoga system is approved by Bhagavad-gītā, but the yoga system in Bhagavad-gītā is especially meant for purification. The aim is threefold: to control the senses, to purify activities and to link oneself to Kṛṣṇa in a reciprocal relationship.  The Absolute Truth is realized in three stages: impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā (Supersoul) and ultimately Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the final analysis, the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. Simultaneously He is the all-pervading Supersoul within the hearts of all living entities and within the core of all atoms, and He is the brahma-jyotir, or the effulgence of spiritual light, as well. Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa is full of all opulence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but at the same time He is full of all renunciation. In the material world we find that one who has much opulence is not very much inclined to give it up, but Kṛṣṇa is not like this. He can renounce everything and remain complete in Himself.  When we read or study Bhagavad-gītā under a bona fide spiritual master we should not think that the spiritual master is presenting his own opinions. It is not he who is speaking. He is just an instrument. The real speaker is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is both within and without. At the beginning of His discourse on the yoga system in the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says,  anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca na niragnir na cākriyaḥ  Everyone is working and expecting some result. One may ask, What is the purpose of working if no result is expected? A remuneration or salary is always demanded by the worker. But here Kṛṣṇa indicates that one can work out of a sense of duty alone, not expecting the results of his activities. If one works in this way, then he is actually a sannyāsī; he is in the renounced order of life."
    }, {
      "text" : "According to Vedic culture, there are four stages of life: brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa. Brahmacārī is student life devoted to training in spiritual understanding. Gṛhastha life is married householder life. Then upon reaching the approximate age of fifty, one may take the vānaprastha order-that is, he leaves his home and children and travels with his wife to holy places of pilgrimage. finally he gives up both wife and children and remains alone to cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that stage is called sannyāsa, or the renounced order of life. Yet Kṛṣṇa indicates that for a sannyāsī, renunciation is not all. In addition, there must be some duty. What then is the duty for a sannyāsī, for one who has renounced family life and no longer has material obligations? His duty is a most responsible one; it is to work for Kṛṣṇa. Moreover, this is the real duty for everyone in all stages of life.  In everyone's life there are two duties: one is to serve the illusion, and the other is to serve the reality. When one serves the reality, he is a real sannyāsī. And when one serves the illusion, he is deluded by māyā. One has to understand, however, that he is in all circumstances forced to serve. Either he serves the illusion or the reality. The constitutional position of the living entity is to be a servant, not a master. One may think that he is the master, but he is actually a servant. When one has a family he may think that he is the master of his wife, or his children, or his home, business and so on, but that is all false. One is actually the servant of his wife, of his children and of his business. The president may be considered the master of the country, but actually he is the servant of the country. Our position is always as servant—either as servant of the illusion or as servant of God. If, however, we remain the servant of the illusion, then our life is wasted. Of course everyone is thinking that he is not a servant, that he is working only for himself. Although the fruits of his labor are transient and illusory, they force him to become a servant of illusion, or a servant of his own senses. But when one awakens to his transcendental senses and actually becomes situated in knowledge, he then becomes a servant of the reality. When one comes to the platform of knowledge, he understands that in all circumstances he is a servant. Since it is not possible for him to be master, he is much better situated serving the reality instead of the illusion. When one becomes aware of this, he attains the platform of real knowledge. By sannyāsa, the renounced order of life, we refer to one who has come to this platform. Sannyāsa is a question of realization, not social status."
    }, {
      "text" : "It is the duty of everyone to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and to serve the cause of Kṛṣṇa. When one actually realizes this he becomes a mahātmā, or a great soul. In Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa says that after many births, when one comes to the platform of real knowledge, he \"surrenders unto Me.\" Why is this? Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. 7.19]. The wise man realizes that \"Vāsudeva [Kṛṣṇa] is everything.\" However, Kṛṣṇa says that such a great soul is rarely found. Why is this? If an intelligent person comes to understand that the ultimate goal of life is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, why should he hesitate? Why not surrender immediately? What is the point in waiting for so many births? When one comes to that point of surrender, he becomes a real sannyāsī. Kṛṣṇa never forces anyone to surrender unto Him. Surrender is a result of love, transcendental love. Where there is force and where there is no freedom, there can be no love. When a mother loves a child, she is not forced to do so, nor does she do so out of expectation of some salary or remuneration.  Similarly, we can love the Supreme Lord in so many ways—we can love Him as master, as friend, as child or as husband. There are five basic rasas, or relationships, in which we are eternally related to God. When we are actually in the liberated stage of knowledge, we can understand that our relationship with the Lord is in a particular rasa. That platform is called svarūpa-siddhi, or real self-realization. Everyone has an eternal relationship with the Lord, either as master and servant, friend and friend, parent and child, husband and wife, or lover and beloved. These relationships are eternally present. The whole process of spiritual realization and the actual perfection of yoga is to revive our consciousness of this relationship. At present our relationship with the Supreme Lord is pervertedly reflected in this material world. In the material world, the relationship between master and servant is based on money or force or exploitation. There is no question of service out of love. The relationship between master and servant, pervertedly reflected, continues only for so long as the master can pay the servant. As soon as the payment stops, the relationship also stops. Similarly, in the material world there may be a relationship between friends, but as soon as there is a slight disagreement, the friendship breaks, and the friend becomes an enemy. When there is a difference of opinion between son and parents, the son leaves home, and the relationship is severed. The same with husband and wife; a slight difference of opinion, and there is divorce.  No relationship in this material world is actual or eternal. We must always remember that these ephemeral relationships are simply perverted reflections of that eternal relationship we have with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We have experience that the reflection of an object in a glass is not real. It may appear real, but when we go to touch it we find that there is only glass. We must come to understand that these relationships as friend, parent, child, master, servant, husband, wife or lover are simply reflections of that relationship we have with God. When we come to this platform of understanding, then we are perfect in knowledge. When that knowledge comes, we begin to understand that we are servants of Kṛṣṇa and that we have an eternal love relationship with Him."

      "text" : "In this love relationship there is no question of remuneration, but of course remuneration is there, and it is much greater than whatever we earn here through the rendering of service. There is no limit to Śrī Kṛṣṇa's remuneration. In this connection there is the story of Bali Mahārāja, a very powerful king who conquered a number of planets. The denizens of the heavenly planets appealed to the Supreme Lord to save them, for they had been conquered by the demoniac king, Bali Mahārāja. Upon hearing their pleas, Śrī Kṛṣṇa took the shape of a dwarf brāhmaṇa boy and approached Bali Mahārāja, saying, \"My dear king, I would like something from you. You are a great monarch and are renowned for giving in charity to the brāhmaṇas, so would you give Me something?\"  Bali Mahārāja said, \"I will give You what You want.\"  \"I simply want whatever land I can cover in three steps,\" the boy said.  \"Oh, is that all?\" the king replied. \"And what will You do with such a small piece of land?\"  \"Though it may be small, it will suffice Me,\" the boy smiled.  Bali Mahārāja agreed, and the boy-dwarf took two steps and covered the entire universe. He then asked Bali Mahārāja where He was going to take His third step, and Bali Mahārāja, understanding that the Supreme Lord was showing him His favor, replied, ' 'My dear Lord, I have now lost everything. I have no other property, but I do have my head. Would You so kindly step there?\"  Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was then very much pleased with Bali Mahārāja, and He asked, \"What would you like from Me?\"  \"I never expected anything from You,\" Bali Mahārāja said. \"But I understand that You wanted something from me, and now I have offered You everything.\"  \"Yes,\" the Lord said, \"but from My side I have something for you. I shall remain always as an order-carrier servant in your court.\" In this way the Lord became Bali Mahārāja's doorman, and that was his return. If we offer something to the Lord, it is returned millions of times. But we should not expect this. The Lord is always eager to return the service of His servant. Whoever thinks that the service of the Lord is actually his duty is perfect in knowledge and has attained the perfection of yoga."

      "text" : "It is a fact, therefore, that in the progress of the living entity toward the perfection of yoga, birth in a family of yogīs or devotees is a great boon, for such a birth gives one special impetus.  prayatnād yatamānas tu yogī saṁśuddha-kilbiṣaḥ aneka-janma-saṁsiddhas tato yāti parāṁ gatim  When one is finally freed from all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection of the yoga system—Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Absorption in Kṛṣṇa is the perfect stage, as Kṛṣṇa Himself confirms:  bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ  Thus after many lifetimes of executing pious activities, when one becomes freed from all contaminations arising from illusory dualities, he engages in the transcendental service of the Lord. Śrī Kṛṣṇa concludes His discourse on this subject in this way:  yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ sa me yuktatamo mataḥ  It therefore follows that the culmination of all yogas lies in bhakti-yoga, the rendering of devotional service unto Kṛṣṇa. Actually, all of the yogas delineated in Bhagavad-gītā end on this note, for Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate destination of all the yoga systems. from the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called jñāna-yoga, or the yoga of knowledge. When jñāna-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called aṣṭāṅga-yoga. And, when one surpasses aṣṭāṅga-yoga and comes to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, that is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand the other processes. The yogī who is progressive is therefore on the true path to eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name—karma-yogī, jñāna-yogī, dhyāna-yogī, rāja-yogī, haṭha-yogī, etc.—but if one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yoga systems.  Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the last link in the yogic chain, the link that binds us to the Supreme Person, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Without this final link, the chain is practically useless. Those who are truly interested in the perfection of the yoga process should immediately take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, understanding Bhagavad-gītā, and rendering service to Kṛṣṇa through this society for Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thereby surpass all other systems and attain the ultimate goal of all yoga—love of Kṛṣṇa."

Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority, recommended the eightfold yoga system. The first step of this yoga system is to select a very secluded and sacred place. Eightfold meditation cannot be performed in a fashionable city. It is not possible. In India, therefore, those who are very serious about practicing yoga go to Hardwar, a very secluded place in the Himalayas, where they remain alone and follow a very restrictive process for eating and sleeping. There is no question of mating. Those rules and regulations must be followed very strictly. Simply to make a show of gymnastics is not perfection of yoga. Yoga means control of the senses. If you indulge your senses unrestrictedly but make a show of yoga practice, you will never be successful. You have to select a sacred place; then you have to sit with half-closed eyes and concentrate on the tip of your nose. You cannot change your posture. There are many rules and regulations which cannot possibly be followed at the present.  Even 5,000 years ago, when circumstances in the world were different, this yoga system was not practicable. Even such a great personality as Arjuna, who belonged to the royal family and was a great warrior and an intimate friend of Kṛṣṇa's, constantly living with Him, after hearing this process of yoga from Kṛṣṇa in a face-to-face discussion, said, \"My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible to follow.\" He flatly admitted, \"For me these rules and regulations and practice for controlling the mind are not possible.\" We have to think, then: 5,000 years ago a personality like Arjuna expressed his inability to practice this eightfold yoga system, so how can we follow it now?  In this age people are very short-lived. In India the average duration of life is thirty-five years. In your country it may be more than that. But actually, whereas your grandfather lived for 100 years, you cannot. These things are changing. The duration of life will be reduced. There are predictions in the scriptures that in this age, man's duration of life, his mercy and his intelligence are being reduced. Men are not very powerful; their duration of life is very short. We are always disturbed, and we have practically no knowledge about spiritual science."

      "text" : "For example, in the hundreds and thousands of universities all over the world there is no department of knowledge where the science of the soul is taught. Actually, we are all spirit soul. From Bhagavad-gītā we understand that we are transmigrating from one body to another, even in our present lives. All of us had at one time the body of a small baby. Where is that body? That body is gone. Presently I am an old man, but I remember that I was once a small baby. I still remember when I was about six months old; I was lying down on the lap of my elder sister, who was knitting, and I was playing. I can remember that, so it is possible for everyone to remember that he had a small body. After the baby's body I had a boy's body; then I had a youthful body, and now I am in this body. Where are those bodies? They are gone now. This is a different body. It is explained in Bhagavad-gītā that when I give up this body, I will have to accept another body. It is very simple to understand. I have changed so many bodies, not only from childhood to boyhood to youth, but according to medical science we are changing bodies every second, imperceptibly. This Process indicates that the soul is permanent. Although I have changed many bodies, I remember my baby body and my childhood body—I am the same person, soul. Similarly, when ultimately I change this body, I shall have to accept another. This simple formula is stated in Bhagavad-gītā. Everyone can reflect on it, and there must be scientific research done in this area.  Recently I received a letter from a doctor in Toronto. He suggested that there is body and there is soul. I corresponded with him. Actually, it is a fact. The soul is there. There is so much evidence, not only in the Vedic literature but even by ordinary experience. The soul is there, and it is transmigrating from one body to another, but unfortunately there is no serious study on this subject in the universities. This is not very good. The Vedānta-sūtra says, \"This human form of life is meant for searching out the spirit, the Absolute Truth.\" The yoga system is used to search out the spiritual principles within this material world. That process for searching is recommended in Bhagavad-gītā by Kṛṣṇa Himself. When Arjuna said, \"The system You are recommending, the haṭha-yoga system, is not possible for me,\" Kṛṣṇa assured him that he was the greatest of all yogīs. He pacified him by saying not to bother about being unable to practice haṭha-yoga. He told him, \"Of all different types of yogīs—haṭha-yogīs, jñāna-yogīs, dhyāna-yogīs, bhakta-yogīs, karma-yogīs—you are the best yogī.\" Kṛṣṇa says, \"Of all yogīs, the one who is constantly thinking of Me within himself, meditating upon Me within the heart, is the first-class yogī.\"  Who can think of Kṛṣṇa always within himself? This is very easy to understand. If you love someone, you can think of him always within you; otherwise it is not possible. If you love someone, then naturally you think of him always. That is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā. One who has developed love of God, Kṛṣṇa, can think of Him constantly. When I speak of Kṛṣṇa you should understand that He is God. Another name for Kṛṣṇa is Śyāmasundara, which means that He is blackish like a cloud but very beautiful. In one verse of Brahma-saṁhitā it is said that a santa, a saintly person, who has developed love for Śyāmasundara, Kṛṣṇa, thinks of the Lord constantly within his heart. Actually, when one comes to the point of samādhi in the yoga system, he thinks, without cessation, of the Viṣṇu form of the Lord within the heart. He is absorbed in that thought."
    }, {
      "text" : "Kṛṣṇa, Śyāmasundara, is the original Viṣṇu. That is stated in Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣṇa includes Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and everyone else. According to Vedic scripture, He expands first as Baladeva, Baladeva expands as Saṅkarṣaṇa, Saṅkarṣaṇa expands as Nārāyaṇa, and Nārāyaṇa expands as Viṣṇu (Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu). These are Vedic statements. We can understand that Kṛṣṇa is the original Viṣṇu, Śyāmasundara.  This is the perfect system. Anyone who is thinking of Kṛṣṇa always within himself is a first-class yogī. If you want perfection in yoga, don't be satisfied only by practicing codes. You have to go further. Actually, the perfection of yoga is reached when you are in samādhi, always thinking of the Viṣṇu form of the Lord within your heart, without being disturbed. Therefore yogīs go to a secluded place, and by controlling all the senses and the mind and concentrating everything on the form of Viṣṇu, they reach samādhi. That is called perfection of yoga. Actually this yoga system is very, very difficult. It may be possible for some solitary man, but for the general mass of people it is not recommended in the scriptures: harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam/ kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā [Cc. Ādi 17.21]. \"In this age of Kali one must chant the holy names of the Lord for deliverance. There is no other alternative. There is no other alternative. There is no other alternative.\" (Bṛhan-Nāradīya Purāṇa)  The yoga system, as it was recommended in the Satya-yuga, the Golden Age, was to always meditate on Viṣṇu. In the Tretā-yuga one could practice yoga by performing great sacrifices, and in the next age, Dvāpara-yuga, one could achieve perfection by temple worship. The present age is called Kali-yuga. Kali-yuga means the age of quarrel and disagreement. No one agrees with anyone else. Everyone has his own theory; everyone has his own philosophy. If I don't agree with you, you fight me. This is the symptom of Kali-yuga. The only method recommended in this age is chanting the holy name. Simply by chanting the holy name of God, one can attain that perfect self-realization which was attained by the yoga system in the Satya-yuga, by performance of great sacrifices in the Tretā-yuga, and by large-scale temple worship in the Dvāpara-yuga. That perfection can be attained by the simple method of Hari kīrtana. Hari means the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kīrtana means to glorify."

      "text" : "This method is recommended in the scriptures, and it was given to us by Caitanya Mahāprabhu 500 years ago. He appeared in a town which is known as Navadvīpa. It is about sixty miles north of Calcutta. People still go there. We have a temple center there. It is also a sacred place of pilgrimage. Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared there, and He started this mass saṅkīrtana movement, which is conducted without discrimination. He predicted that this saṅkīrtana movement would be spread all over the world and that the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra would be chanted in every village and town on the surface of the globe. In pursuance of the order of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, following in His footsteps, we are trying to introduce this saṅkīrtana movement, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and it is proving very successful everywhere. I am preaching especially in foreign countries, all over Europe, America, Japan, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, etc. I have introduced this saṅkīrtana movement, and now we have centers around the world. All eighty centers are being received with great enthusiasm. I have not imported these boys and girls from India, but they are taking this movement very seriously because it appeals to the soul directly.  We have different stages of our life—the bodily concept of life, the mental concept of life, the intellectual concept of life, and the spiritual concept of life. Actually we are concerned with the spiritual concept. Those who are allured by the bodily concept are no better than cats and dogs. If we accept that \"I am this body,\" then we are not better than the cats and dogs because their concept of life is like that. We must understand that \"I am not this body,\" as Kṛṣṇa wanted to impress upon Arjuna in the beginning of His teaching of Bhagavad-gītā: \"First of all, try to understand what you are. Why are you lamenting in the bodily concept of life? You have to fight. Certainly you have to fight with your brothers, brothers-in-law and nephews, and you are lamenting. But first of all understand whether you are body or not.\" That is the beginning of Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣṇa tried to make Arjuna understand that he was not his body. This instruction was not for Arjuna exclusively, but for everyone. First of all we have to learn that \"I am not this body,\" that \"I am spirit soul.\" That is Vedic instruction."

      "text" : "As soon as you come to this point of being firmly convinced that you are not this body, that is called the brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20] stage of Brahman realization. That is knowledge, real knowledge. Advancement of knowledge for eating, sleeping and mating is animal knowledge. A dog also knows how to eat, how to sleep, how to mate and how to defend. If our education extends only to these points (the dog is eating according to his nature, and we are also eating, but in a nice place, with nicely cooked food on a nice table), that is not advancement. The principle is still eating. Similarly, you may sleep in a very nice apartment in a six-story building or in a 122-story building, and the dog may lie in a street, but when he sleeps and when you sleep, there is no difference. You cannot know whether you are sleeping in a skyscraper or on the ground because you are dreaming something which has taken you from your bed. You have forgotten that your body is lying there on the bed, and you are flying in the air, dreaming. Therefore, to improve the sleeping method is not advancement of civilization. Similarly, the dog has no social custom for mating. Whenever there is a she-dog, he mates on the street. You may mate very silently, in a secret place (although now people are learning how to mate like dogs), but the mating is there. The same principle applies to defending. A dog has teeth and nails with which he can defend himself, and you have atom bombs. But the purpose is defending, that's all. Therefore, scripture says that human life is not meant only for these four principles of life, bodily demands. There is another thing—a human being should be inquisitive to learn what is Absolute Truth. That education is lacking.  According to Vedic civilization a brāhmaṇa is a learned man, or one who knows the spirit. In India, brāhmaṇas are addressed as learned men, but in fact they cannot be brāhmaṇas by birth. They are expected to know what is spirit.  By birth everyone is a śūdra, a fourth-class man, but he may be reformed by the purificatory process. There are ten kinds of purificatory processes. One undergoes all these processes and at last comes to the spiritual master who gives him the sacred thread as recognition of his second birth. One birth is by your father and mother, and the other birth is by the spiritual master and Vedic knowledge. That is called second birth. At that time the candidate is given a chance to study and understand what is Veda. By studying all the Vedas very nicely, he actually realizes what is spirit and what is his relationship with God, and then he becomes a brāhmaṇa. Above that situation of impersonal Brahman understanding, he comes to the platform of understanding Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; then he becomes a Vaiṣṇava. This is the perfectional process."

      "text" : "Yoga means the connecting link between the soul and the Supersoul, or the Supreme and the minute living creatures. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is that Supreme, the Personality of Godhead. Being, therefore, the ultimate object of yoga, Kṛṣṇa's name is yogeśvara, the master of yoga.  At the conclusion of the Bhagavad-gītā, it is said: \"Where there is Kṛṣṇa, and where there is Arjuna, the greatest of bowmen, there, undoubtedly, is victory.\"  The Bhagavad-gītā is a narrative spoken by Sañjaya, the secretary of Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra. This is just like airwaves from the radio: the play is going on in the auditorium, but you can hear from your room. So, just as we now have such a mechanical arrangement, at that time there were also certain arrangements, although there was no machine. Anyway, the secretary of Dhṛtarāṣṭra could see what was going on in the battlefield, and he was in the palace, telling this to Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who was blind. Now, the conclusion made by Sañjaya was that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  When the yoga performance is described, it is said that Kṛṣṇa's name is yogeśvara. No one can be a better yogī than the master of yoga, and Kṛṣṇa is the master. There are many different types of yoga. Yoga means the system, and yogi means the person who practices that system. The object of yoga, the ultimate goal, is to understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to practice the topmost type of yoga.  This topmost yoga system was described by Kṛṣṇa in the Gītā to His most intimate friend, Arjuna. In the beginning, the Lord said that this system can be practiced only by a person who has developed attachment for it. This Kṛṣṇa conscious yoga system cannot be practiced by an ordinary man who has no attachment for Kṛṣṇa, for it is a different system, and the topmost—bhakti-yoga.  There are five types of direct attachment, and there are seven types of indirect attachment. Indirect attachment is not bhakti. Direct attachment is called bhakti. If you are attached to Kṛṣṇa by the direct method, it is called devotional service, and if you are attached to Kṛṣṇa by an indirect method, it is not devotional service. But that is also attachment. King Kaṁsa, for example, was the maternal uncle of Kṛṣṇa; and there was a warning that Kaṁsa would be killed by one of his sister's sons. So he became very anxious about the sons of his sister, and he decided to kill his sister. Devakī, Kṛṣṇa's mother, was saved by her husband, Vasudeva, who made a compromise and proposed to his brother-in-law as follows: \"You are afraid of the son of your sister. So your sister herself is not going to kill you.\" He requested, \"Don't kill your sister. Save her, and I promise that all the sons born of her will be brought to you, and if you like you can kill them.\""
    }, {
      "text" : "Vasudeva did this in order that his poor wife might be saved. And Vasudeva thought, \"When Devakī's son is born, Kaṁsa may have a change of heart.\" But Kaṁsa was such a great demon that he killed all the sons of Devakī. It was told that the eighth son of the sister would kill him. So, when Kṛṣṇa was in the womb of His mother, Kaṁsa was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. You may say that he was not Kṛṣṇa conscious, but actually he was. Not directly, not for love's sake, but as an enemy. He was Kṛṣṇa conscious as an enemy. So, that is not devotional service. One in devotional service is Kṛṣṇa conscious as Kṛṣṇa's friend, Kṛṣṇa's servant, His parent, or His lover.  You may want Kṛṣṇa as your lover, or as your son; you may want Kṛṣṇa as your friend, you may want Kṛṣṇa as your master, you may want Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Sublime. These five different kinds of direct relationships with Kṛṣṇa are called devotion, or bhakti. They entail no material profit.  The concept of accepting God as a son is superior to the concept of accepting God as a father. There is a distinction. The relationship between father and son is that the son wants to take something from the father. The father's relationship with the son is that the father always wants to give something to the son. Therefore, the relationship with God or Kṛṣṇa as son is better than the relationship with Kṛṣṇa by one who thinks, \"If I accept God as my father, then my business will be to ask for my necessities from the father.\" But, if I become the father of Kṛṣṇa, then from the very beginning of His childhood, my business will be to serve Him. The father is the parent of the child from the very beginning of his birth; therefore the concept of this relationship of Vasudeva and Devakī is sublime.  Kṛṣṇa's foster mother, Yaśodā, is thinking, \"If I do not feed Kṛṣṇa sumptuously, He will die.\" She for. gets that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, that He is sustaining the three worlds. She forgets that only one Lord is supplying the necessities of all the living entities. This same Personality of Godhead has become the son of Yaśodā, and she is thinking, \"If I do not feed Him nicely, He will die.\" This is love. She has forgotten that it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has appeared before her as a little child."
    }, {
      "text" : "This relationship of attachment is very sublime. It requires time to understand, but there is a position where, instead of asking, \"O God, please give us our daily bread,\" you can instead think that God will die if you do not supply bread to Him. This is the ecstasy of extreme love. There is such a relationship between Kṛṣṇa and His devotee Rādhārāṇī, the greatest devotee, the greatest lover of Kṛṣṇa. Mother Yaśodā is His lover as a parent; Sudāmā is His lover as a friend; Arjuna also as a friend—there are millions and billions of different kinds of direct devotees of Kṛṣṇa.  So the yoga systems as described here lead to bhakti-yoga, and bhakti-yoga can be practiced by persons who have developed attachment to Kṛṣṇa. Others cannot practice it. And, if anyone is able to develop that attachment, the relationship will be that he will understand God, Kṛṣṇa, perfectly. However we may try to understand God by our different theories or speculations, it is still a difficult job. We may say that we have understood God, but it is not possible to understand Him as He is, because we have limited senses, and He is unlimited.  It is said in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam that our senses are imperfect, all of them. We cannot understand even the material world perfectly. You have seen so many planets and stars in the sky at night, but you do not know what they are. You do not even know what the moon planet is, though men have been trying for so many years to go there in sputniks. Even this one planet, Earth! We do not know what varieties there are even on this planet! If you go to the sea, to the sky, your perception is limited. Our knowledge is, therefore, always imperfect. On that we must agree. If we foolishly think that we have acquired all forms of knowledge and we have advanced in science, this is another foolishness. It is not possible.  And, when it is not possible to understand even the material things which we daily see with our eyes, what can we say of the spiritual world and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He is the supreme spiritual form, and it is not possible to understand Him by our limited senses. Then why are we bothering so much for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if it is not possible? If these imperfect senses cannot realize Kṛṣṇa as He is? The answer is that if you become submissive, if you develop the spiritual attitude of following Kṛṣṇa, and you are as a servant or a friend, as a parent or as a lover—if you begin to give service to the Supreme Lord then you can begin to know Him."

      "text" : "Your service begins with the tongue. How? By the tongue you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and by the tongue you can taste Kṛṣṇa prasādam, spiritual food. So, the beginning of the process is very nice. You can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare—and whenever prasādam is offered to you by Kṛṣṇa, by His kindness, you accept it. The result will be that if you become submissive, and if you begin this service—chanting and eating prasādam—Kṛṣṇa will reveal Himself before you.  You can't understand Kṛṣṇa by speculation; that is not Possible, because your senses are imperfect. But if you begin this process of service, then it will be possible—one day Kṛṣṇa will reveal Himself to you: \"I am like this.\" just as Kṛṣṇa is revealing to Arjuna. Arjuna is a devotee, and he is submissive, and he is in contact with Kṛṣṇa as a friend. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is revealing to him.  The Bhagavad-gītā was spoken to Arjuna, not to any Vedāntist philosophical speculator. In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter, you will note that Kṛṣṇa says, \"I am speaking to you that ancient system of yoga.\" It is stated, \"unto you.\" Arjuna was a kṣatriya, a fighter. He was a householder, not even a sannyāsī, not a renouncer—but these are not qualifications to understand Kṛṣṇa. Suppose I say I have become a sannyāsī mendicant—this is not a qualification, that I can now understand Kṛṣṇa. Then what is the qualification? This: One who has developed the service spirit, with love and devotion, can understand Me.\" No other. Not the big scholars and mental speculators; but a child can understand Kṛṣṇa, if he has full faith in Him. So faith and devotion qualify one.  Simply by such faith and service you will understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness; we are not wasting your time or our time, because we are in full faith that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Theoretically or practically, you should accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Person. Theoretically, there is the revealed scripture. You will understand from the Vedic literature, from the great devotees in the past and in the present."

      "text" : "For the present, there is Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya is the great authority. None is greater. He was mad after Kṛṣṇa. And then, after Him, His six disciples, the gosvāmīs, have left us an immensely valuable literature—especially Jīva Gosvāmī. They have written volumes on Kṛṣṇa. So, under disciplic succession, we have come to this point; and if you like past history, then go back a long, long time to Vyāsadeva. He is known to have written the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and other literature on Kṛṣṇa. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is nothing but a description of Kṛṣṇa. Vyāsa is also the writer of the Bhagavad-gītā. The Gītā was spoken by Kṛṣṇa and noted down by Vyāsa, who put this Gītā into the Mahābhārata.  So Vyāsadeva accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Person. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam he has given the description of the different incarnations; there are twenty-five of Them. And, in the conclusion, he says that the descriptions that are given of different incarnations are all parts of the representations of God. But Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. He is not part, but one hundred percent—one hundred percent God. So there is the evidence of authority.  And, practically, if we believe the śāstras, the scriptures, then we can see: Who can be more powerful than Kṛṣṇa? Who can be more beautiful than Kṛṣṇa? Who can be more famous than Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa appeared five thousand years ago, but His knowledge, which He gave in the form of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā, is still worshiped. It is worshiped not only by the Hindus or the Indians, but is read all over the world. In your country there are at least fifty different editions of the Bhagavad-gītā, written by different men. Similarly, in England, in Germany, in France and in all other countries, you will find hundreds of editions of the Gītā. So, who can be more famous? There are many other evidences, if you believe in śāstra: Kṛṣṇa married 16,108 wives, and He provided each one of them with a big palace, and each one of them had 10 children, and from the 10 children there were many other children born. So we have the evidence of revealed Scriptures; and in the Brahma-saṁhitā also, Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is a very old book, supposed to have been written by Brahmā, the first living being in the universe.  In that Brahma-saṁhitā, it is said, īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ [Bs. 5.1]. Īśvara means God. There are many gods. It is said that there are so many demigods, and there is the Supreme God. So Brahma-saṁhitā says, īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ—He is the God of gods. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ, and then: sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ—and His body is eternal, and full of bliss and knowledge. And next: anādiḥ—He has no beginning, but He is the beginning of everyone. Anādir ādir govindaḥ. Go means senses, go means cow, and go means land. He is the proprietor of all land, He is the proprietor of all cows, and He is the creator of all senses."

How can you say that somebody, by his thinking, by speculation, can say something about God that is more important than what is being said by Kṛṣṇa Himself? It is not possible. No one can speak better than Kṛṣṇa about God, because God Himself is speaking. If you speak about yourself personally, who can say more than you? So, if you have faith, if you believe theoretically or practically in Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, by the speeches that are delivered by Kṛṣṇa in the Bhagavad-gītā, you can understand God. There is no difficulty.  And, if you believe Kṛṣṇa, then the result will be that you can understand God—how He is working, how His energies are acting, how He is manifesting, what is this material world, what is the spiritual world, what are the living creatures, what is their relationship—so many things are to be found in God's literature.  The whole Vedic literature deals with three things: the first is your relationship with God; then, next, after you understand your relationship with God, you can act in that way. just as a man or woman may not be related, but as soon as the relationship is established that one is husband and the other is wife, then the dealings begin."

But that is really a lesser relationship. If you understand God perfectly, then there are intimate relationships also. Your intimate relationship will be revealed when you are perfectly liberated. Each and every living creature has a particular relationship with God, but we have, for now, forgotten. When that relationship is revealed in the process of devotional activities, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you will know that that is the perfection of your life. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a great science; it is not a sentimental speculation regarding love. It is based on scientific propositions described in the Bhagavad-gītā, in the Vedas, and in the Brahma-saṁhitā; and it is accepted by authorities like Lord Caitanya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nārada, Asita, Vyāsa—there are so many authorities. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not an ordinary lovemaking or moneymaking business; it is reality, and if you stick to it seriously, your life will be perfect.  Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad-gītā, \"After giving up this body, one who knows Me in truth does not come back again to this material world to accept a material body.\" Then what happens to him? He goes to Kṛṣṇa, back home, back to Godhead. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is directly giving people understanding of Kṛṣṇa. We are giving knowledge of Kṛṣṇa based on these authorized scriptures: Bhagavad-gītā and the Vedas. Veda means knowledge, and Vedānta means the ultimate end of knowledge. What is that end of knowledge? That is Kṛṣṇa. Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. 15.15]. By knowing all the Vedas, the ultimate conclusion should be Kṛṣṇa. This conclusion comes after many, many births. After culturing knowledge for many, many births, when one actually becomes wise, then he surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa. How can he surrender? He knows that Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is everything. Whatever we see is simply a manifestation of the energy of Vāsudeva. One must be convinced on this point, and then he becomes a devotee. Kṛṣṇa therefore advises that whether you understand or not, simply surrender unto Him. What Kṛṣṇa taught in Bhagavad-gītā, we are also teaching, without different manufactured ideas. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is open to everyone, and the process is very simple. We have our centers. If you want to take advantage of this movement, you are welcome.

Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has given us full liberty to gratify our senses.  We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa; we have small particles of all the desires of Kṛṣṇa. Our existence is a small particle of God's, just like a small particle of gold which has all the qualities of the original gold. Kṛṣṇa has the propensity for sense gratification. He is the original sense gratifier. It is stated in Bhagavad-gītā that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer. Our enjoying spirit exists because it exists originally in Kṛṣṇa.  The Vedānta-sūtra says that everything originates from Kṛṣṇa. Param Brahman, or the Absolute Truth, means that from which everything is generated. Therefore, our desire for sense gratification is coming from Kṛṣṇa. Here is the perfect sense gratification—Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī. Young boys and girls are similarly trying to enjoy their senses, but where is this propensity coming from? It is coming from Kṛṣṇa. Because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the quality of desire for sense gratification exists within us. But the difference is that we are trying to gratify our senses in the material world; therefore we are perverted. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness one gratifies his senses in association with Kṛṣṇa. Then it is perfect.  For example, if there is a nice sweetball or some nice foodstuff and the finger picks it up, it cannot enjoy. The foodstuff has to be given to the stomach, and then the finger can also enjoy. Similarly, we cannot gratify our senses directly. But when we join with Kṛṣṇa, when Kṛṣṇa enjoys, then we can enjoy. That is our position. The finger cannot eat anything independently; it cannot enjoy the nice sweetball. The finger can pick it up and put it in the stomach, and when the stomach enjoys, then the finger enjoys."

      "text" : "We have to purify the propensity of material sense gratification. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For Kṛṣṇa consciousness we have to be purified. What is that purification? We cannot enjoy anything directly, so we have to enjoy through Kṛṣṇa. For example, we take prasādam. The nice prasādam, the foodstuff that is prepared, is not taken directly—we take it through Kṛṣṇa. First of all, we offer to Kṛṣṇa, and then we take it.  What is the difficulty? There is no difficulty, but you become purified. The eating process is the same, but if you eat directly then you become materialistically encumbered. If you offer to Kṛṣṇa, however, and then take it, then you become freed from all contamination of material life. That is stated in Bhagavad-gītā. Devotees take prasādam after offering it to Kṛṣṇa. That is called sacrifice. Whatever you offer to Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu is called sacrifice. Whatever we do here, within this material world, is some sort of sinful activity, even if we do not know it. Killing is sinful activity, even if we do not kill willingly. When you walk down the street you are killing many animals. Whenever you drink water, you are also killing. Below a water pot there are many ants and microbes that are being killed. Whenever you light a fire, there are many small microbes that also burn in the fire. When you grind spices with a mortar and pestle, many small microbes are killed.  We are responsible for this. Willingly or unwillingly, we are becoming entangled in many sinful activities. Therefore, Bhagavad-gītā says that if you take the remnants of foodstuff after offering sacrifice, you become freed from all contamination. Otherwise, one who cooks to eat personally without offering to Kṛṣṇa is simply eating sinful reactions. This is our position. Therefore, it is stated that because people generally cannot control their senses, they engage in the materialistic way of life in which repeated birth and death in different species takes place.  I do not know what is my next life, but the next life will come. Before us there are many species of life; I can take birth in any one of them. I can become a demigod, I can become a cat, I can become a dog, I can become Brahmā—there are so many forms of life. In the next life I shall have to accept one of these forms, even if I do not want to. Suppose someone asks, \"In your next life would you like to take the form of a dog or a hog?\" I would not like it. But the law of nature says that after giving up this body, when I am not existing in this body any more, I will have to accept another body according to my karma. That is in the hands of nature. It is arranged by superior supervision. You cannot order, \"Give me the body of Brahmā, give me the body of Indra or a king or something exalted.\" That is not in your hands or in my hands; that will be judged by the superior agency of God, Kṛṣṇa, and you will be given a body. Therefore, it is our duty to prepare a body which will help us go back to Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

One should not take instruction from anyone unless one accepts him as a guru. But even one who has a nice guru cannot remain Kṛṣṇa conscious if he is determined to remain in this material world. If my determination is to remain in this material world to enjoy material life, then for me Kṛṣṇa consciousness is impossible.  Everyone in the material world is engaged in all kinds of political, philanthropic and humanitarian activities to make material life happy and prosperous, but this is not possible. One should understand that in the material world, however one may try to make adjustments, he cannot be happy. To cite an example I have given many times, if you take a fish out of water, you can give it a very comfortable velvet bedstead, but still the fish cannot be happy; it will die. Because the fish is an animal of the water, it cannot be happy without water. Similarly, we are all spirit soul; unless we are in spiritual life or in the spiritual world, we cannot be happy. That is our position.  Everyone is trying for that spiritual realization. But we do not know. Therefore, we are trying to be happy here, in material conditions. We are becoming frustrated and confused. Therefore, we have to withdraw this understanding that we shall be very happy by making adjustments to this material world. Then Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be effective.  The boys and girls who are our students have been very scornful of the materialistic way of life. Their fathers and guardians are not poor. There is no scarcity of food or material enjoyments. Why are they being frustrated? You may say that because India is poverty-stricken the people are frustrated, but why have American boys and girls been frustrated? That is the proof that the materialistic way of life cannot make you happy. You may go on for some time trying to become happy, but happiness will never come from materialistic life. That is a fact. Those who are trying to be happy by making material adjustments cannot take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Frustration and confusion with materialistic life is the qualification to come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These boys and girls have a good qualification; they are coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is a verse in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam which states that sometimes to show special favor to His devotees Kṛṣṇa takes away all one's material opulence. For example, the Pāṇḍavas were bereft of their kingdom, although Kṛṣṇa was present there. Kṛṣṇa was present as their friend, and still they were bereft of their kingdom. They lost their property, their wife was insulted, and they were driven away to the forest."

So this frustration of the American and English boys with the materialistic way of life is a good sign for accepting Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of course, one does not need to become poor to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But if anyone has the desire to become spiritually advanced while at the same time enjoying material life, that is not possible. These are two contradictory aspirations. One must become determined to be happy in spiritual life. That is real happiness.  This human form is especially meant for coming to that standard of spiritual life by tapasya, by voluntarily rejecting the materialistic way of life. In the history of India there were many great kings like Bharata Mahārāja who even at a very young age practiced tapasya. Bharata Mahārāja at the age of only twenty-four years left his young wife, young children and the whole empire Bhāratavarṣa and went to the forest for meditation. There are many such instances. Prahlāda Mahārāja was questioned by his father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, \"Who has taught you this Kṛṣṇa consciousness?\" A king's son does not mix with anyone else; he simply takes lessons from the appointed teachers. How is it then that this boy, who was only five years old, was so Kṛṣṇa conscious? His father was surprised, so he asked him, \"How have you taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness?\" The answer was, \"My dear father, Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be achieved by a person like you, whose job is always simply to enjoy this material world.\" Hiraṇya means gold, and kaśipu means softly cushioned bed.  Materialistic life is spent chewing the chewed. Take, for instance, a father. A father knows that he has responsibilities, so he works hard to maintain his family. It is very difficult to keep the high standard of living in this age, so one must work very hard and engage one's son in the same way. In spite of very bad experience with materialistic life, still one engages his son in the same way. This happens again and again, so it is like chewing chewed things. Once I have chewed sugar cane and taken its juice, it is thrown out in the street, and if someone wants to taste it to see how sweet it is, he is chewing the chewed. Similarly, we don't have very good experience with this materialistic life, this hard struggle for life, but human beings, as it is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, are born of the quality of passion.

That hard work is considered happiness. In London you will see everyone engaged in hard work. In the morning, all the buses and trucks travel with great speed, and people go to the office or factory from morning until late at night. They work hard, and it is called advancement of civilization. Some of them are frustrated; they don't want it. There will be frustration—after all, it is hard work. Hogs, too, are working hard day and night, thinking, \"Where is stool? Where is stool?\"That is their business. Therefore, in one sense this kind of civilization is a hog and dog civilization. It is not human civilization. Human civilization means sobriety. One should be inquisitive. A human being should be inquisitive to know these things: Who am I? Why am I put into this condition of working very hard to get only a few grains? Why am I in this uncomfortable situation? Where did I come from? Where do I have to go? The Vedānta-sūtra begins by stating that a human being should be inquisitive to know who he is, where he comes from, and where he has to go. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is for those who have come to detest this material world. They are good candidates for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They will inquire why these men are working so hard and what their goal in life is.  That is answered in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. people are working so hard because they do not actually know what the goal of life is. Everyone says that he is looking after his self-interest, but he does not know what his self-interest is. Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇu. He should know that his real self-interest is to make progress toward Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They do not know this. Why don't they know it? Because they have hopes which are very difficult to fulfill. I may hope for something which is possible; that is good. But if I hope for something which is never possible, that is hope which will never be fulfilled.  We are a composition of the external and internal energies of God. The gross external energy is this gross material body, and the subtle external energy is the mind, ego and intelligence. Behind both energies—the gross external energy and the subtle external energy—is the soul, the internal energy. This body is made of earth, water, fire, air and ether. This is called gross external energy, and there is also a subtle external energy of mind, intelligence and false ego. And behind that, the soul is there."

Thus we are covered.  I may think that simply by having a nice shirt and coat I can be happy, but is it possible? Unless you eat nicely, unless you sleep nicely, unless you have your sense gratification, will you be happy simply by putting on a costly shirt and coat? No. That is not possible. We want to be happy by adjustment of this external energy. That cannot be. You are spirit soul—you must have spiritual food, you must have a spiritual life, and then you can be happy. As you cannot be happy simply by having a nice shirt and coat, similarly simply by the materialistic way of life you cannot be happy. There is gross matter and subtle matter. Gross matter includes high skyscraper buildings, machines, factories, nice roads, good cars, etc. Subtle matter includes nice songs, poetry, philosophy, etc. People are trying to be happy with this gross and subtle material existence. That cannot be.  Why have people accepted this sort of civilization? Because they are led by blind leaders. We are conducting this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and very few are interested. But suppose we advertise some falsehood—\"If you follow this path, within six months you will become God, and you will be all-powerful.\" Many people would come. This is actually one blind man leading other blind men. Suppose one blind man says, \"All right, come, follow me. I shall help you crossing this busy Mulberry Street.\" He is blind, and the followers are also blind. The result will be that they will be hit by some car or truck and they will all die."

Otherwise, if one who is blind takes instruction from a blind man, it will not be possible for him to be liberated from material bondage.  What is self-interest? What is the interest of a child when it is crying? It is searching after the mother's breast. Anyone who knows this immediately brings the child to its mother—\"Take care of your child; he is crying.\" The mother takes him to her breast, and the child is immediately happy. The child cannot express what he wants, so he simply cries. But one who knows what he is crying for helps him, and the child becomes happy. Similarly, because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we are actually crying for Kṛṣṇa. But these false leaders, these blind leaders who do not know, are giving stone instead of bread.  How can one be happy? I have already explained the gross external energy and the subtle external energy. Those who are interested in this gross and subtle external energy will never have their ambition of life fulfilled. One who is interested in Viṣṇu and in showing the path of Viṣṇu is the real friend. One who is giving Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the real friend of the world. No others can give happiness to human society. That is the explanation given by Prahlāda Mahārāja.  You cannot manufacture a process of happiness by tackling this material energy. That is not possible because the material energy is not under your control. It is controlled by the Supreme. How can you overpower the material energy? It is not possible. That is explained in Bhagavad-gītā. It is not possible to overcome the stringent laws of material nature. Kṛṣṇa says, \"It is My energy; I am the controller. But one can surrender unto Me.\""

If a citizen is disobedient to the state law, he is immediately put into police custody. Similarly, anyone who has rebelled against the superiority of God is put under the stringent laws of material nature, and he must suffer. That is the position. Therefore, his self-interest is to seek out the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. That will make him happy. Otherwise, if he simply tries to accept material things and become happy, that is not possible.  Prahlāda Mahārāja gives a hint as to how one can seek out the path of Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He says that we have created so many unnecessary things and become entangled by them. In the beginning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated that we should desire to get out of this unnecessary trouble and to be free from the problems which are created. This morning I saw a picture of Berlin which was sent by one of my disciples. I have been to Berlin and to Moscow, and both are very nice cities. Berlin is a very nice city and London is also a very nice city, but why do the people engage in fighting and bombing every other city? Why has this happened? Because they have lost their interest in Viṣṇu, God. Therefore, they are thinking, \"You are my enemy; I am your enemy,\" and they fight like cats and dogs. But as soon as we come to the Viṣṇu understanding, the Kṛṣṇa understanding, these advanced cities, these advanced civilizations, can be maintained very nicely. You'll be happy, you'll eat nicely, dance nicely, live nicely and go back home, back to Godhead. Enjoy this life and the next life. That is our request.  Everyone should take the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement seriously and try to understand it seriously. It is authorized on the Vedic principle; it is not something manufactured or unauthorized. We are opening centers in different parts of the world to give an opportunity for people to understand their real interest: Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa. That is our mission. Kindly help us and join us."

      "text" : "In the Bhagavad-gītā, the Sanskrit word mām is frequently used. This word means \"unto me.\" Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, says, \"unto Me\"—Kṛṣṇa. We cannot interpret this in a different way. When I say, \"Bring me a glass of water,\" it means that I am the person in want of the glass of water, and if you supply to me and not to others, then it is right. When Kṛṣṇa says, \"unto Me,\" that means Kṛṣṇa. But philosophers are still interpreting—they say \"unto something else.\" Even grammatically this is wrong.  One who has developed attachment to Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa conscious. They say if you have attachment for your lover you always think of her. That is lover consciousness. It is natural. It is stated that a woman who has another lover besides her husband shows herself very attentive to her household duties, but is always thinking, \"When shall my lover and I meet in the night?\" This is an example. It is possible, in spite of our false engagement, if we love somebody, to think of him always. If materially it is possible, why not spiritually? That is the whole teaching of the Bhagavad-gītā.  In the Gītā, Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, \"As a fighter, you have to fight. You cannot step away from the fighting. It is your duty.\" Nowadays I have practical experience that the draft board of your country is calling for boys to join the army, but they are not willing. They are not willing because they are not trained as kṣatriyas, warriors. They are trained as śūdras, laborers. Therefore the caste system is very scientific. A section of people should be trained as brāhmaṇas, men of knowledge. Those who are intelligent enough in the society should be picked and trained in higher philosophical science. And those who are less intelligent than the brāhmaṇas should be given military training. We require everything in society—not only military men. How can everyone be a military man? Because they are sending śūdras, ordinary workers, to Vietnam, these are unnecessarily being killed. Any country which is very proud of scientific advancement, and yet does not know how to organize its society, is a fool's society."

Some are inclined toward spiritual advancement, and these are the brāhmaṇas. Now we are training boys who are spiritually inclined and they are unnecessarily being forced into military service. The foolish have no knowledge that some boy is being trained up in higher science. Why should he be destroyed when he is being perfected? The intellectual persons, those boys who have brahminical qualifications, are being restrained in brahmacarya student life: they don't take to meat-eating, they don't take part in illicit sex. They are being trained as complete brāhmaṇas, the highest intellectuals, the most purified persons in society. If there is one brāhmaṇa in a whole family, then the whole family—the whole society-becomes sanctified. But today they have no knowledge of how to train a brāhmaṇa, or how to train a kṣatriya. In the other fields of action, in the work of śūdras and vaiśyas there is nice training. If anyone wants to be a businessman, there are colleges or technological schools. That's very nice. But why should everyone be dragged into technology? Just as in your body: for proper maintenance we require the head, the arms, the belly and the legs. All these parts of the body are required. You cannot say, \"We do not require the head.\" That is nonsense—we require everything. Suppose there is a body without a head—it is a dead body. If the body is now intact, but there is no head, it is called a dead body. The head is considered to be the intellectual part of the body. Similarly, if there is no brāhmaṇa in the society, it is a dead body. If there is no spiritual man in the society, it is a dead society.  Therefore, Kṛṣṇa says, \"I have created the four divisions of society, according to quality and work.\" If someone is working as a brahmacārī-brāhmaṇa and has acquired the quality of understanding Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, then why should he be called for army action? The arm of the body is the kṣatriya. Of course that is required; to protect the society, to protect the country, a military arrangement should be there. No one will disapprove. But not the brāhmaṇas. It is putting a race horse before the work cart. A race horse is required for different purposes. The other beasts of burden—asses, mules and oxen—are required for pulling carts.  I say this frankly—everyone may read it—that any society where there are no spiritual persons or Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a rascal society, because it has no head. Where there is a headless man, there is a dead body. And if there is no brain, there is no head; if the brain is not working properly then he is a madman; if he has no head at all, then he is a dead man."

The men who are leading the society, the President and the Secretary of Defense, should have the intelligence to understand this science of the soul.  The other day when coming to your country I met a secretary of the Japanese government in Tokyo. I wanted to explain to him that he should cooperate with this movement, but he said, \"Oh, we cannot cooperate with any religious movement.\" He is one of the chief secretaries of the government, and he is such a fool. He is taking this movement as a religious movement, just as we have so many sentimental religions. But this is not sentimental. This is the necessity of society: a class of men should be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise the society is doomed; it is going to hell. And, when such rascals are at the head of the government, how can there be peace? How can you expect peace in a dog's society? The dogs are by nature howling—\"Woof! Woof! Woof!\"—as soon as they see other dogs. So do you mean to say there will be peace if you turn human society into dog society, into cat society, into tiger society? The tiger is very powerful; he can kill many other animals. But does that mean he is a very important animal? No, he has no use in society. And now we are very powerful, and we have good weapons to fight with, and we can kill many people. But these are no qualifications for good men or a good society.  We are not meant to manufacture a society of monkeys or tigers or asses—or rascals who work very hard. Do you mean to say a society of asses will derive any benefit from life? No.  For those who have developed an attraction to Kṛṣṇa, attachment can be developed. Before my coming to the West, there was no movement like this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but now it is developing. Kṛṣṇa was not born in your country; you do not accept Kṛṣṇa as your religious God. But Kṛṣṇa is so attractive that although you are a foreigner, you are not foreign. To Kṛṣṇa you are not a foreigner. He claims everybody. We make Him foreign, but this is our foolishness."

They say Kṛṣṇa is Indian or Kṛṣṇa is worshiped by the Hindus and therefore He is one of the Hindu Gods; and they think that Kṛṣṇa is saying, \"Yes, I am the Hindu God. Yes, I am Indian.\" But He is like the sun. Why American sun or Indian? Nothing is American or Indian; that is all artificial.  \"This planet belongs to the humans, that's all.\" This is your communism. This present communism is defective because the Russians say that Russia is for the Russians or China is for the Chinese. Why not for others? Just think in terms of human communism! Why human communism? Living being communism! If you take this world as belonging to human society, that is defective. It belongs to everyone! It belongs to the tree community; it belongs to the beast community. They also have a right to live. Why should you cut the trees? Why should you send the bulls to the slaughterhouse? This is injustice. How can you gain justice by yourself doing injustice? We have no Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We do not know that Kṛṣṇa is our original father and that we are all His sons. The tree is my brother, the ant is my brother, the bull is my brother. The American is my brother, the Indian is my brother, the Chinese is my brother. Therefore, we have to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We talk all this nonsense of universal brotherhood and United Nations—all nonsense. Either you acknowledge the Father, or else you have no idea of how to realize brotherhood or humanity. Therefore, they are talking for years and years. They are the same fools. Can't you see the U.N.? They have headquarters in New York. They are simply talking nonsense, that's all. That is their business. So unless there is full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there cannot be any improvement of the world condition.  Kṛṣṇa says that you have to develop your attachment for Him. Begin at the beginning, but you can do it; it is not artificial. I have a few sincere students here, just developing; they are not complete, but they are developing Kṛṣṇa—attachment. Otherwise, why should they waste their time chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa? They are doing it, and it can be done. You can develop love for anything if you try for it. But Kṛṣṇa development is very natural. Because Kṛṣṇa is not a thing belonging to a particular type of religion or sect. Kṛṣṇa claims, \"I belong to everyone.\" Therefore originally, we are all connected with Kṛṣṇa; but we have simply forgotten. This process of chanting is to evoke your remembrance of Kṛṣṇa. It is not that we are inducting something artificially into you. No, Kṛṣṇa is already connected with you, but you have forgotten.

Just as, whether you say earring or necklace or bangle or wristwatch, these are all made of gold, and so they are gold.

There is no spiritual knowledge.  In the material way, suppose you take a piece of paper and tear it into particles and throw it all over. The original paper has no existence. This is material. But we get information from the Vedas that the Absolute Truth is so perfect that if you take away the whole, still the whole remains. One minus one equals one.

But one must know how he can derive Kṛṣṇa from the features of Kṛṣṇa's form in wood or iron or metal.  You have to learn how to contact Kṛṣṇa everywhere in everything. That is explained in the system of yoga. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also yoga, the perfect yoga, the highest of all yogic systems.

All of our students are simply anxious to be overloaded with work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. \"Prabhupāda, what can I do?\" And they are actually doing it. In the material world, if you work for some time you'll feel weak.  Of course, I am not exercising myself. I am an old man of seventy-two years. I was ill, I went back to India; but I want to work. Actually, I could retire from all these activities, but as far as I can, I want to work; I want to learn day and night. At night I will work with the dictaphone, and I am sorry if I cannot work. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One must be very anxious to work. It is not an idle society. No, we have sufficient engagements: editing papers, selling papers.  Simply find out how Kṛṣṇa conscious you can be. If you want to be really at peace, if you want to be happy, then develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And the beginning is to develop attachment for Kṛṣṇa. The process which we have prescribed is chanting and dancing before the Deities, and offering prasādam, spiritual food. This will make you more Kṛṣṇa conscious."

      "text" : "The yoga system as it is described in the Bhagavad-gītā is different from the bogus yoga system which is going on in the West these days. The yoga systems which have been introduced into the West by so-called yogīs are not bona fide. Yoga is difficult: the first thing is to control the senses. That is the position of the yogī: he is not allowed to indulge in sex life. If you indulge in intoxication, if you indulge in meat-eating, and if you indulge in gambling and sporting—all nonsense—you cannot at the same time become a yogī. I was astonished when a yogī came here, having advertised in India that you can be a yogī even though you may be addicted to drinking. This is not the yoga system. This is not standard. You can call it yoga, but it is not the standard yoga system.  The yoga system is especially difficult for this age. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam we understand that yoga means to concentrate one's attention on the Superself, Viṣṇu. He is situated in your heart. And, in order to concentrate your attention, you have to control the senses. The senses are working just like infuriated horses. If you cannot control the horses of your carriage, it will be dangerous. Just imagine that you are seated in a carriage and your horses are so furious that they are dragging you to hell. Then what is your position? The yoga system means to control these senses. The senses are also compared to serpents: The serpent does not know who is its friend and who is its enemy. It bites anyone. And, as soon as the serpent bites, the result is death. Similarly, if the uncontrolled senses work in their own way, then you should know that you are in a dangerous position.  It has been said that when one becomes too sensual, he loses his temper, he loses his identity, he forgets himself. Infuriated by the senses, a man will attack even his children, even his daughter. Therefore, for those who are advancing in spiritual life—not only for them but for everyone—the śāstras, scriptures, say that you should not sit in a secluded place even with your mother, even with your daughter or your sister. Why? Because the senses are so strong that if they become infuriated, you will forget whether she's mother, sister, or daughter.  You may say that this may be true only for some foolish persons, but śāstra says no—you should not sit in a secluded place even with your mother, sister or daughter, because the senses are so strong that even though you may be very moral, you may still be attracted by sex."

This body is the cause of all miseries, and the ultimate goal of life should be to get out of this material body and be situated in the spiritual body. This is a foreign atmosphere. The soul is free spiritually, but it has been conditioned by this material atmosphere. And the body is of this matter.  A human being is fit to inquire as to whether he is this body or something else. This can be understood very easily. I am not this body, because at the time of death the body remains—although everyone cries, \"Oh, the poor man is gone!\" The man is lying there. Why do you say he is gone? He is lying there! At that time, we can come to our senses: the body is not the man. The real man is gone. The childhood body is changed to the youthful body, and the childhood body is gone. Similarly, when the boyhood body is gone, you'll have to accept a body like mine, an old man's body. The body is changing. Not only year after year, but at every second the body is changing. Still, you are situated there. This is very simple to understand. And because the body is there, we are suffering. Everyone is trying to get out of suffering, in any field of action; in the economic field, in the political field, or any field of activity, social or national, everyone is trying to get out of misery. There is no other activity. Either nationally or socially, individually or collectively, we are all suffering; and this suffering is due to the body.  Yoga means to inquire. What am I? If I am not this body, then what am I? I am pure soul. Now, if my bodily activities or sensual activities are incorrect, I will not be able to understand myself—what I am—and the Bhagavad-gītā says that we are all grand fools. Why fools? Since we have this body, we are fools. If somebody invites you to come to his apartment but you know it is full of danger, do you think you would like to go there? \"Oh no,\" you will say, \"I am not going there. If it is full of danger, why shall I go?\" Similarly, don't you think that the body is full of danger? Then, why are you going there, taking repeated birth? When you are flying in a plane, you are always fearful that there may be a crash. And what is this crashing? It is due to the body. The soul cannot be affected by crashes. But you are always afraid.  The soul is ever-existing, and the body will not exist. And because you are existing and the soul has accepted the nonexisting body, therefore you suffer."

Permanent life is enjoyment, but due to the fever you cannot enjoy life. When you are sick you cannot go out; you have to rest and take so many medicines and formulas. But we don't want that—\"Why should I be a sick person?\" But you are diseased. Similarly, we should always know that this bodily conditional stage of the pure soul is a diseased condition. And anyone who does not know that he is suffering from disease is a fool. He is Fool Number One.  The śāstra says, everyone is born a fool: because he has this body, therefore he was born a fool. No being, either American or Indian, cat or dog, is free from this. You have come to disease, that's all. If you feel, \"I am an American,\" that is a kind of disease; if you feel, \"I am an Indian,\" that is also a disease; if you feel, \"I am a cat,\" that is a disease. You are not a cat, you are not a dog, you are not Indian, you are not fair, you are not black. You are your soul—that is your identity! And one who does not understand this truth, that \"I am pure soul,\" is defeated in all his activities.  Lord Jesus Christ taught like that: If you lose your soul and gain the whole world, what do you gain? People do not know what they are, and yet they work just like madmen. Just see, all these people are working, and they are madmen. They are not Americans or Indians, Germans or Japanese. They are nothing of the kind. They have been given a chance to come to this naughty place, this Earth; and so, being born in a particular place, they have a particular kind of body—and they are mad after it.  The Bhagavad-gītā says that just as our outer garments are changed, so this body is changed. Yoga means the process of getting out of this material embodiment. Just as you are repeating changes of dress, so you are repeating birth and death, and this is the cause of your miseries. If you do not understand this, then all your activities end in defeat."

We do not mean birth beginning historically from a certain day and ending on a certain day. No; the soul is not like that—it has no beginning, and it has no end. But in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that the soul is part and parcel of God. God is eternal, God is full of joy and bliss. The position of the Absolute Person, the Godhead, is that He is full of bliss, eternal, and full of knowledge. And, because we are also part and parcel of the Supreme, we have partial blissfulness and eternality, and we are full of knowledge, according to our infinitesimal size.  The human beings are understood to be the most intelligent of all living creatures, but they are misusing their intelligence. How? They are misusing their intelligence by devoting it to the animal propensities. These animal propensities are eating, sleeping, mating and fearing. You can analyze the trend of modern civilization: everyone is busy with these four principles of animal life. They are sleeping and creating some cushions for comfortable sleep. They are creating palatable dishes for the eating propensity. They are exciting sex very nicely, for the mating necessity. And they are defending their country with so many atom bombs—that is the fear propensity.  But these symptoms you will find among the animals. They are also sleeping according to their own ways, and they are defending. They may not have the atom bomb, but they have some way of defending. You can kill your enemy, or he can kill you, but there is actually no defense. You cannot defend yourself; wherever you drop the bomb, it will hurt you, due to nuclear radiation. So this is not the solution of your problems. The solution of your problems is to get out of the conditioned state of life. That is called yoga—to link yourself to the Supreme."

Everything is arranged very nicely; and yet the fools say there is no brain behind it, but it is all happening automatically.  The fact is that there is God, Kṛṣṇa, and we are all parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa. We have been conditioned in some way or other in this material atmosphere. But now we have this human form of life, and so we have to get out of the entanglement. But getting out is not possible. You cannot get out of the entanglement of the material body unless you develop your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not artificial—don't think that. This is the greatest necessity of the human being. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, God consciousness, is there within you. Don't you find, when there is a kīrtana performance, that the more innocent a person is, the sooner he begins? Immediately, the child begins to clap, begins to dance. This is within him; and it is very simple, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  So, unless you develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no rescue from the entanglement of conditioned life. This you have to understand. This is not some sentiment. No, it is a great science. You have to understand it nicely. Then the human form of life will be successful, and otherwise it is defeated. You may become a very great nation, but that is not the solution of the problem of life.  By the grace of Kṛṣṇa, I am able to serve you with my life's energy. I left the United States in 1967 in poor health; but life and death—everything—depends on Kṛṣṇa. I thought, \"Let me go back to Vṛndāvana, because Vṛndāvana is a sanctified place where Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very strong.\" I thought that I might go there and die in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of course, if you are always in the atmosphere of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then here also you can have Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana is not a particular place that is called Vṛndāvana. Kṛṣṇa says, \"It is not that I live in the Kingdom of God, Vaikuṇṭha; nor is it that I live in the heart of the yogī.\" The yogī wants to find out where Kṛṣṇa is within the heart. But Kṛṣṇa says, \"I am not in the abode in the spiritual sky, nor am I in the heart of the yogī.\" Then where are You? Kṛṣṇa says, \"I stay where My pure devotees are chanting My glories.\" That is Vṛndāvana."

Perfect this Kṛṣṇa consciousness; try to understand the philosophy behind it. It is a science, not a bluff. We can speak from any angle of vision.  Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the great necessity of human society. Learn it and appreciate it, comprehend it and assimilate it—and teach it. It is very simple. If you offenselessly chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, everything will be revealed from within because Kṛṣṇa is sitting within you. If you are strong and have faith and conviction in Kṛṣṇa, as well as in the spiritual master, the transparent via medium to Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa is there. The Vedas say that if you have implicit faith in God and implicit faith in your bona fide guru, who teaches you Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the result will be that all the Vedic scriptures will be revealed authoritatively.  The process is spiritual; it does not require any material qualifications. The speculators who are not realized souls are covered in delusion and are simply wasting their time. Whatever they may do in their official class, they remain the same foolish rascals. But our Kṛṣṇa conscious students will feel a change in their lives, a change in happiness, and a change in youth, also. This is reality.  I shall request you, my dear young girls and boys, to take Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously, and you will be happy—your life will be perfected. It will be the sublime addition to your life. It is not a bluff. We have not come here to collect some money. Money is supplied by Kṛṣṇa. I am going back and forth to India—not only I, but my students as well. For a rich man there would be many expenditures; it would cost ten thousand dollars or such trips. But our business is Kṛṣṇa, and He will supply. I do not know where the money comes from, but Kṛṣṇa supplies. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you will be happy. You are the young generation; you are the flower of your country and society. practice this most sublime system, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Be happy and make others happy.

      "text" : "The Bhagavad-gītā says that out of many thousands of human beings, one may try to make perfection of his life. Man is an animal, but he has one special prerogative, rational thought. What is that rational thought? Reasoning power, argument. Now, reasoning power is there in dogs and cats as well. Suppose a dog comes up to you; if you say, \"Hut!\" he'll understand. The dog will understand that you don't want him. So, he has some reasoning power. But what is the special reasoning power of the human being?  As far as the bodily necessities are concerned, the reasoning power is there even in the animal. If a cat wants to steal some milk from your kitchen, she has very nice reasoning power: she is always looking to see when the master is out and she can take. So, for the four propensities of animal life—eating, sleeping, mating and defending—there is reasoning power even in beasts. Then, what is the special reasoning power of the human being, by which he is called the rational animal?  The special reasoning power is to inquire, \"Why am I suffering?\" This is special reasoning. The animals are suffering, but they do not know how to remedy the suffering. But human beings are making scientific advancement and philosophical advancement, cultural advancement, religious advancement—progress in so many lines—because they want to be happy. \"Where is the point of happiness?\" This reasoning power is especially given to the human being. Therefore, in the Gītā, Kṛṣṇa says, \"Out of so many men, one may know Me.\"  Generally, the people are just like animals. They simply do not know anything beyond the necessities of the body: how to eat, how to sleep, how to mate and how to defend. And the Bhagavad-gītā says, out of many thousands, someone may develop this reasoning power: \"Why am I suffering?\" He asks this question: \"Why am I suffering?\" We do not want to suffer, but suffering is forced upon us. We do not want too much cold, but too much cold and too much heat are forced upon us.  When there is some impetus to awaken this reasoning power, it is called brahma jijñāsā. This is found in the Vedānta-sūtra. The first verse says that now, this human form of life is meant for asking the question of how to solve the problem of suffering."

      "text" : "So Kṛṣṇa says that this special prerogative of the human being is nut awakened very easily, except by some good association. Just as we have this Kṛṣṇa conscious association. If we attain such association, where nice things are discussed, then that awakening of reason, that special prerogative of the human being, will come. As long as this question does not arise in one's mind, he should understand that whatever activities he is doing will lead to his defeat. He is simply leading an animal life. But, not when these questions arise: Why am I suffering? What am I? Am I meant for suffering? Am I meant for troubles?  I am undergoing troubles by nature's laws, and by the state's laws. So the question of freedom is how to become free from all these troubles. The Vedānta-sūtra also says that the soul, my actual self, is by nature joyful. Yet, I am suffering. Lord Kṛṣṇa further says that when these questions arise, gradually one comes to God. Those who have awakened to these questions are said to lie on the path of perfection. And, when the question of God and our relationship with God comes, that is our final perfection of life.  Now, Kṛṣṇa says that out of many thousands of people, one may try to make perfection of this life; and out of many millions of such persons on the path of perfection, only one may understand Kṛṣṇa. So understanding Kṛṣṇa is not very easy. But it is also the easiest. It is not easy, but at the same time it is the easiest. It is the easiest if you follow the prescribed forms.  Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has introduced this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. He has not exactly introduced it; it is in the scriptures. But He has especially propagated this formula. In this age this is the easiest method of self-realization. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. It can be done by everyone. In my classroom, I am perhaps the only Indian. My students are all Americans, and they are taking part in the chanting very nicely, chanting and dancing. That means that, in any country, in any place, this can be performed. Therefore it is the easiest. You may not understand the philosophy of the Bhagavad-gītā. That is also not very difficult; but still, if you think that you cannot understand, you can still chant very easily: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa."

This institution is open a little over a year; but some of the students, by simply chanting, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, have advanced in such a way that they can talk about the science of God, and they will very easily answer those human questions. So, this is the easiest method of transcendental meditation.  Kṛṣṇa says that out of many millions of people, one may understand Him. But, by chanting of this Hare Kṛṣṇa, as introduced by Lord Caitanya—chanting and dancing—you can understand Kṛṣṇa within a very short time. Knowledge begins not from Kṛṣṇa, but from things which we are accustomed to see every day.  Land is gross. If you touch it, you can feel its hardness. But, as soon as the land becomes still finer, it is water, and the touch is soft. And then again, from water to fire, still finer. After fire or electricity the air is still finer; and after air, the sky, ether, is finer still. Beyond ether, the mind is still finer; and beyond the mind, intelligence is still finer. And, if you go beyond intelligence to understand the soul, it is finer still. From these elements people have discovered so many sciences. There are many scientists, for example, who are soil experts; they can say, by analyzing a particular type of earth, what kind of minerals are there. Somebody seeks out silver, somebody seeks out gold, somebody seeks out mica. This is knowledge of gross things—the earth. If you go to finer substances, then you study water, or liquid things, such as petrol and alcohol. Go still finer, and from water you will go to fire and electricity. If you study electricity, you have to study all sorts of books. And, from this finer fire, you will come to air. We have so much advancement in our airplanes; we are studying how they move, how they are made—now sputniks and jets—so many things are being discovered.  Next comes the study of the ethereal: electronics, ethereal transformations from one thing to another. Then, finer still, is the mind-psychology and psychiatry. But for intelligence, rationalism, there is only a little philosophical speculation. And what about the soul? Is there any science of the soul? The materialists have none. Material science has advanced to the study of the ether, or the mind and intelligence, but there is no advancement beyond that. Beyond intelligence, they do not know what exists. But here in the Bhagavad-gītā you can find this."

      "text" : "The Bhagavad-gītā begins at the point after intelligence. When Arjuna was perplexed at the outset, his intelligence was perplexed—whether to fight or not to fight. Kṛṣṇa begins the Gītā from the point where intelligence fails. How does knowledge of the soul begin? It is just like a child is playing. You can understand this child's body is now so small, but one day this child will be grown up, like you or me. But the same soul will continue. So, by intelligence, you can understand that although the body is changed, the soul is there. The same soul which was existing in the body of the child is still continuing in the body of the old man. Therefore the soul is permanent, and only the body has changed. This is a very easy thing to understand. And the last change of this body is death. As at every moment, every second, every day, every hour, the body is changing, so the last change is when one cannot act with the body, and so he has to take another one. Just as, when my cloth is too worn out or old, I cannot put it on; I have to take a new cloth. It is similar with the soul. When the body is too old or unworkable, I have to change to another body. This is called death.  This is the beginning of the Bhagavad-gītā, when the preliminary knowledge of the soul is there. And you will find that there are only a few who can understand the existence of the soul as permanent, and of the body as changeable. Therefore Bhagavān, Lord Kṛṣṇa, says that, out of many, many millions of people, one may understand it. But still, the knowledge is there. If you want to understand it, it is not difficult. You can understand it.  Now, we should inquire into the existence of the ego, the finest material substance. What is ego? I am pure soul, but with my intelligence and mind I am in contact with matter, and I have identified myself with matter. This is false ego. I am pure soul, but I am identifying falsely. For example, I am identifying with the land, thinking that I am Indian, or that I am American. This is called ahaṅkāra. Ahaṅkāra means the point where the pure soul touches matter. That junction is called ahaṅkāra. Ahaṅkāra is still finer than intelligence.  Kṛṣṇa says that these are the eight material elements: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. False ego means false identification. Our nescient life has begun from this false identification—thinking that I am this matter, although I am seeing every day, at every moment, that I am not this matter. Soul is permanently existing, while matter is changing. This misconception, this illusion, is called ahaṅkāra, false ego. And your liberation means when you are out of this false ego. What is that status? Ahaṁ brahmāsmi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. That is the beginning of liberation."

Similarly, simply purifying the mind, rejecting this false ahaṅkāra identification—I am not this body, I am not this matter; I am soul—this is not liberation. It is only the beginning of liberation. If you stick to this point, and continue—just as you might continue your activities and keep your temperature at 98.6 degrees—then you are a healthy man.  For example, in the West now there is some propaganda for taking intoxication. The people want to forget the bodily existence. But how long will you forget? There will be a relapse. You can forget for one hour or two, by intoxication, and think that I am not this body. But unless you are actually on the platform of understanding yourself by knowledge, it is not possible to continue. Still, everyone is trying to think, \"I am not this body.\" They have experience that they are suffering so much on account of bodily identification, and so, \"If only I could forget my bodily identification!\"  This is only a negative conception. When you actually realize yourself, simply understanding that you are Brahman will not do. You have to engage in the activities of Brahman. Otherwise you will fall down. Simply flying very high is no solution to the problem of going to the moon. Nowadays the fools are trying to go to the moon, but they simply go 240,000 miles up from the Earth, touch the moon, and return. They are very proud. There is so much talk of aeronautics: crowds and meetings and conferences. But what have they done? What are 240,000 miles in that vast sky? If you go 240 million miles, still you are limited. So this will not do. If you want to go high, you must have permanent shelter. If you can take rest there, then you cannot fall down. But if you have no rest, then you will have to fall down.

You have to not only realize that you are not matter, but you have to engage yourself in the spiritual world. And that spiritual world means to be working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That spiritual world, that functioning of our real life, is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  False ego I have already explained.

It is just as, in delirium, a man is diseased and his brain becomes puzzled, and gradually he forgets himself and becomes a madman. He is gradually forgetting.

The material atmosphere, in which we are now living, is called māyā, or illusion. Māyā means that which is not. And what is this illusion? The illusion is that we are all trying to be lords of material nature, while actually we are under the grip of her stringent laws. When a servant artificially tries to imitate the all-powerful master, it is called illusion. We are trying to exploit the resources of material nature, but actually we are becoming more and more entangled in her complexities. Therefore, although we are engaged in a hard struggle to conquer nature, we are ever more dependent on her. This illusory struggle against material nature can be stopped at once by revival of our eternal Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare is the transcendental process for reviving this original pure consciousness. By chanting this transcendental vibration, we can cleanse away all misgivings within our hearts. The basic principle of all such misgivings is the false consciousness that I am the lord of all I survey.  Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not an artificial imposition on the mind. This consciousness is the original natural energy of the living entity. When we hear the transcendental vibration, this consciousness is revived. This simplest method of meditation is recommended for this age. By practical experience also, one can perceive that by chanting this mahā-mantra, or the Great Chanting for Deliverance, one can at once feel a transcendental ecstasy coming through from the spiritual stratum. In the material concept of life we are busy in the matter of sense gratification as if we were in the lower animal stage. A little elevated from this status of sense gratification, one is engaged in mental speculation for the purpose of getting out of the material clutches. A little elevated from this speculative status, when one is intelligent enough, one tries to find out the supreme cause of all causes—within and without. And when one is factually on the plane of spiritual understanding, surpassing the stages of sense, mind and intelligence, he is then on the transcendental plane. This chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is enacted from the spiritual platform, and thus this sound vibration surpasses all lower strata of consciousness—namely sensual, mental and intellectual. There is no need, therefore, to understand the language of the mantra, nor is there any need for mental speculation nor any intellectual adjustment for chanting this mahā-mantra. It is automatic, from the spiritual platform, and as such, anyone can take part in vibrating this transcendental sound without any previous qualification. In a more advanced stage, of course, one is not expected to commit offenses on grounds of spiritual understanding."

We have seen this practically. Even a child can take part in the chanting and dancing. Of course, for one who is too entangled in material life, it takes a little more time to come to the standard point, but even such a materially engrossed man is raised to the spiritual platform very quickly. When it is chanted by a pure devotee of the Lord in love, it has the greatest efficacy on hearers, and as such this chanting should be heard from the lips of a pure devotee of the Lord, so that immediate effects can be achieved. As far as possible, chanting from the lips of nondevotees should be avoided. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects.  The word Harā is the form of addressing the energy of the Lord, and the words Kṛṣṇa and Rāma are forms of addressing the Lord Himself. Both Kṛṣṇa and Rāma mean the supreme pleasure, and Harā is the supreme pleasure energy of the Lord, changed to Hare (Hah-ray) in the vocative. The supreme pleasure energy of the Lord helps us to reach the Lord.  The material energy, called māyā, is also one of the multi-energies of the Lord. And we the living entities are also the energy, marginal energy, of the Lord. The living entities are described as superior to material energy. When the superior energy is in contact with the inferior energy, an incompatible situation arises; but when the superior marginal energy is in contact with the superior energy, called Harā, it is established in its happy, normal condition.  These three words, namely Harā, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, are the transcendental seeds of the mahā-mantra. The chanting is a spiritual call for the Lord and His energy, to give protection to the conditioned soul. This chanting is exactly like the genuine cry of a child for its mother's presence. Mother Harā helps the devotee achieve the Lord Father's grace, and the Lord reveals Himself to the devotee who chants this mantra sincerely.  No other means of spiritual realization is as effective in this age of quarrel and hypocrisy as the mahā-mantra: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare."

      "text" : "In the Bhagavad-gītā Kṛṣṇa tells His disciple Arjuna, \"I am disclosing a most confidential part of knowledge to you, because you are My dear friend.\" As is stated in the Fourth Chapter, the Bhagavad-gītā is spoken to Arjuna because of his one qualification: he was a devotee. The Lord says that the mystery of the Bhagavad-gītā is very confidential. Without being an unalloyed devotee you cannot know it. In India there are 645 different commentaries on the Gītā. One professor has proposed that Kṛṣṇa is a doctor and Arjuna is His patient and has made his commentary in that way. Similarly, there are commentators and people who have taken it that everyone is perfect, and that they can interpret scripture in their own way. As far as we are concerned, we agree to read the Bhagavad-gītā according to the instructions given in the Gītā itself. This has to be taken through the paramparā, the system of disciplic succession. It is being taught by the Supreme Person because \"you are My dear friend. I desire that you may become prosperous and happy. Therefore I speak to you.\" Kṛṣṇa wants everyone to be happy and peaceful and prosperous, but they do not want it. Sunshine is open to everyone, but if someone wishes to remain in darkness, what can the sunshine do for him? So the Gītā is open to everyone. There are different species of life, and lower and higher grades of understanding exist—that is a fact. But Kṛṣṇa says that this knowledge is for anyone. If one has lower birth or whatever, it doesn't matter. The Bhagavad-gītā offers transcendental subject matter everyone can understand provided he goes along with the principle as stated in the Fourth Chapter. That is, that the Gītā is coming down in disciplic succession: \"I first of all instructed this yoga system to the sun-god Vivasvān, who taught it to Manu, who taught it to Ikṣvāku.\" From Kṛṣṇa the disciplic succession is coming down, but \"in course of time the disciplic succession was broken.\" Arjuna is therefore made the new disciple. In the Second Chapter, Arjuna surrenders: \"So far we have been talking as friends, but now I accept You as my spiritual master.\" Anyone following the principle in this line accepts the guru as Kṛṣṇa, and the student must represent Arjuna. Kṛṣṇa is speaking as the spiritual master of Arjuna, and Arjuna says, \"Whatever You are saying I accept.\" Read it like that—not: \"I like this, so I accept it; this I don't like, and so I reject it.\" Such reading is useless nonsense.  The teacher must be a representative of Kṛṣṇa, a devotee, and the student must be like Arjuna. Then this Kṛṣṇa consciousness study is perfect. Otherwise it is a waste of time. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated: \"If anyone wants to understand the science of Kṛṣṇa, he should associate with pure devotees. When discussions take place among pure devotees, the potency of spiritual language is revealed.\" Scholarly discussion of the Gītā is futile. In the Upaniṣads it is stated: \"To one who has firm faith in God, and similar faith in God's representative, all the import of Vedic language will be revealed.\" We must have the qualification of being a devotee. Become dear to God. My spiritual master used to say, \"Don't try to see God. Act in such a way that God will see you.\" We have to qualify ourselves. By your qualification God Himself will come and see you."

We are always dissatisfied in the material world in circumstances that won't continue; happiness is temporary, and temporary plight also will not exist for much time. Cold, heat, duality—it is all coming and going. To get to the absolute stage is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa is seated in everyone's heart, and as you become purified He will show you the path. And in the end you will quit this body, and you will go to the spiritual sky.  \"No one knows Me,\" Kṛṣṇa says, \"My influence, My power and My extent. Even the maharṣis [the great thinkers] don't know. I am the origin of all demigods and the origin of all ṛṣis.\" There are so many forefathers we don't know of, and there are Brahmā and the demigods—what do we know? We can't reach to the platform where we can grasp God. We gather knowledge by limited senses, and Kṛṣṇa can't be reached by the mind, the center of the senses. Imperfect senses can't grasp perfect knowledge. Mind and sense manipulation can't reach Him. If you engage the senses in the service of the Lord, however, then He will reveal Himself through your senses.  People may say, \"What is the use of understanding God? What is the use? Let Him stay in His place, let me stay in my place.\" But in the śāstras, the scriptures, it is stated that pious activities will raise us to beauty, knowledge and good birth; and that by impious (sinful) activities, we suffer. Suffering is always there, pious or impious, but a distinction is made. He who knows God, however, becomes freed from all possible sinful reactions, which no amount of piety can accomplish. If we reject God we can never be happy.  Not even considering human society, if you take the demigods who are more advanced and intelligent, they also don't know Kṛṣṇa. The seven great sages whose planet is near the North Star also do not know. Kṛṣṇa says: \"I am the original, the source of all these demigods.\" He is the father of everything, not only the origin of demigods, but of the sages—and the universe. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam describes how the universal form took place, and everything is emanating from Him. Also Kṛṣṇa is the origin of Paramātmā, the Supersoul; and the impersonal brahma-jyotir, the shining effulgence, is in Him. Of everything, of every conception, \"I am the source.\" The Absolute Truth may be realized in three phases, but is one nondual truth. Brahman (the glowing effulgence), localized Supersoul, and Bhagavān—the Supreme Person—are three features or aspects of God."

      "text" : "If no one knows the Supreme Personality of Godhead, how can He be known? He can be known when the Supreme Lord comes before you and reveals Himself to you. Then you can know. Our senses are imperfect, and they cannot realize the Supreme Truth. When you adopt a submissive attitude and chant, realization begins from the tongue. To eat and to vibrate sound is the business of the tongue. If you can control your tongue for prasādam, spiritual food, and make the sound vibration of the holy name, then by surrender of the tongue you can control all the other senses. If you cannot control your tongue, you cannot control your senses. Taste prasādam and become spiritually advanced. You can have this process at your home: offer vegetarian foods to Kṛṣṇa, chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and offer obeisances:  namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca jagat-hitāya kṛṣṇāya govindāya namo namaḥ  Everyone can offer, and then take the food with friends. And chant before the picture of Kṛṣṇa, and lead a pure life. Just see the result—the whole world will become Vaikuṇṭha, where there is no anxiety. All is anxious with us because we have accepted this material life. Just the opposite is so in the spiritual world. No one, however, knows how to get out of the material concept. Taking an intoxicant doesn't help; the same anxieties are there when you are finished being drunk. If you want to be free and want life eternal with bliss and knowledge, take to Kṛṣṇa. No one can know God, but there is this way:. the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated that no one can conquer Him or approach Him, but He becomes conquered. How? Let people remain in their own positions, but let them give up nonsense speculation through volumes of books. Thousands of books are printed and read, and after six months thrown away. This way and that—how can you know the Supreme by speculation on the information supplied by your blunt senses? Give up research—throw it away—just become submissive; acknowledge that you are limited and subordinate to material nature and to God. No one can be equal to or greater than God. So be submissive. Try to hear about the glories of the Supreme Lord from authorized sources. Such authority is handed over by disciplic succession. If we can understand by the same authority as Arjuna, that is real authority. God is always ready to reveal; you just become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Follow the path traversed by the great ācāryas, the devoted teachers, and then everything will be known. Although He is unconquerable and unknowable, He can be known in your home."

As soon as you understand, you will know that the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, but that He is not caused by any other cause. And He is the master of all planets. This is not accepting blindly. God has given you the power of reason, the power of arguing—but don't argue falsely. If you want to know the transcendental science you must surrender. Surrender to authority and know Him by signs. Don't surrender to a fool or a rascal. Find one who is coming in disciplic succession, one who is fully convinced about the Supreme Absolute Truth. If you find such a person, surrender and try to please him, serve him and question him. Surrender unto Him is surrender to God. Question to learn, not to waste time.  The process is there, but if we waste time by intoxication we will never see Him, the unconquerable Lord. Follow the principles and slowly but surely, without doubt, you will know. \"Yes, I'm making progress,\" you'll say. And it is very easy, and you can execute it and be in a happy mood. Study, take part with music, eat prasādam. And no one can cheat you by this process. But if you want to be cheated—go to the cheaters.  Try to understand it from the authoritative source and apply it in your life. Amongst the dying mortals, you will become the most intelligent because you are freed from sinful actions. If you act only for Kṛṣṇa, then you are freed from all reactions. You will have no anxiety over what is auspicious or inauspicious because you will be in touch with the most auspicious. This is the process. Ultimately, we can get in touch with Kṛṣṇa. Life will be successful. Anyone can adopt it, because it is very simple.  Here is a nice formula presented by Kṛṣṇa Himself: one should understand the position of Kṛṣṇa. He is unborn and without any cause. We have experience, all of us, that we are born, and we have a cause; our father is our cause. If someone poses himself as God, he has to prove that he is unborn and uncaused. Our practical experience is that we are born. Kṛṣṇa is not born. We have to understand this. Understanding this is to be firmly convinced He is the cause, but is not caused; and since He is not caused He is the proprietor of all manifestation. One who understands this simple philosophy is not illusioned."

How long will I go on claiming, in body after body, \"This is my land! This is my land!\"? Is it not nonsense? One has to be out of illusion. We should know that whatever we are doing in the material concept of life is illusion. We have to understand whether we are illusioned or not. And all conditioned souls are illusioned. He who learns to be disillusioned gets free of all encumbrances. If we want freedom from all bonds, then we have to understand God. There is no neglecting this; it is our prime duty.  Out of millions of entities, one may be enlightened. Generally we are all born fools. As soon as I take birth I am nurtured by parents and educated to falsely claim a land as my own. National education means to make you more foolish. Am I not foolish? I am changing my body like a dress life after life. You have so many minds, so many dresses—why do you claim this one? Why don't you understand: \"This dress is nice, but next moment I may be in another.\" You are in the grip of nature. You cannot say what dress you will have: \"Nature, make me American.\" No; material nature controls. If you live like a dog—here, take a dog's dress. If you live a godly life—here, take God.  Out of many fools someone tries to understand what I actually am. Dog? American? Russian? This real inquiry goes on. If you inquire, you have to ask someone, not just yourself. When crossing the street in a place you don't know, you have to ask the policeman or some gentleman. For \"what I am\" you have to go to an authority also. What is a spiritual master? He is a person conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa. Ordinarily nobody inquires; but if a man does, he can make progress and come to this understanding: Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes.  Four kinds of people, followers of scripture and higher authority, inquire about Kṛṣṇa. Those addicted to sinful activities can't inquire. They go on in intoxication. The righteous, pious man inquires and goes to God. Facility is given to people in this process by the authority—to make people happy, not to exploit people. The purpose of ISKCON is, in this way, to understand the science of God. You want happiness. Here it is. You are distressed by sinful reactions. But if there is no sinful reaction there is no suffering. One who knows Kṛṣṇa without doubt is relieved of all reactions. Kṛṣṇa says, \"Come to Me, and I will give you freedom from all reactions.\" Don't disbelieve it. He can give you shelter; He has all power. If I give you such a promise, because I have no such power I may break the promise."

There is no question of disbelieving; it is simply foolishness. The dormant relationship is there. You want to serve Kṛṣṇa, but simply by the spell of illusion we think we have no connection with Kṛṣṇa. We go on doing all \"independent\" nonsense and we are always anxious. When we associate with these dormant feelings for Kṛṣṇa, however, we will become engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  \"God is unborn\" indicates that He is different from the material world. We have no such experience of the unborn. This city was born—history is filled with dates. Spiritual nature, however, is unborn, and at once we can see the difference. The material nature is born. You have to understand; if Kṛṣṇa is unborn then He is spiritual, not like one of us. Kṛṣṇa is not some \"extraordinary person who was also born.\" He is not born. So how can I decide He is an ordinary man? \"Those who are fools and rascals think of Me as an ordinary man,\" Kṛṣṇa says in the Gītā. He is different from everything in this world. He is anādi, without cause.  Kṛṣṇa may be spiritual, but there are other spiritual bodies. We have spiritual bodies like Kṛṣṇa's, but they are born. They are not exactly born; it is like the sparks of the fire. The sparks are not born from the fire; they are actually there. We are also not born; we are sparks that come out of the original form. Even if we are not born, the spark comes out of Kṛṣṇa, so we are different; the sparks of the fire are fire, but they are not the original fire. As for quality, we are the same as Kṛṣṇa. It is like the difference between father and son. Father and son are different and nondifferent at the same time. The son is an expansion of the father, but he cannot claim that he is the father; that would be nonsense.  Because Kṛṣṇa is declaring Himself supreme proprietor, He is therefore different from anything. If I am the proprietor of New York State, I am still not New York State. In every step there is duality. No one can say we are completely one with God.  When you can understand Kṛṣṇa's and your own position in a nice analytical way, then at once you become free from sinful reactions. This process will help you. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and cleanse your mind, and you will receive the message. One has to be qualified. If you chant and hear, for no payment, you will approach God.

      "text" : "We require to hear about the method of relishing the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the most elevated text on the science of God consciousness, the matured and ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic wisdom. The Sanskrit word rasa means juice, just like the juice of an orange or a mango. And the author of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam requests that you kindly try to taste the rasa, or juice, of the fruit of the Bhāgavatam. Why? Why shall I taste the juice of the fruit of the Bhāgavatam? Because it is the ripened fruit of the Vedic desire tree. As a desire tree, whatever you want you can have from the Vedas. Veda means knowledge; it is so complete that whether you want to enjoy in this material world or you want to enjoy spiritual life, both kinds of knowledge are there. If you follow the Vedic principles, then you will be happy. This is like the codes of the state. If the citizens obey, then they will be happy, there will be no criminal trespassing, and they will enjoy life. The state does not come to you for nothing just to trouble you, but if you live according to the state law there is no question of unhappiness.  Similarly, this conditioned soul, the living entity, has come here to this material world for enjoyment and for material happiness. And the Vedas are the guidance: all right, enjoy—but you enjoy according to these principles. That is called Veda. Therefore, everything is there. Just as we sometimes perform a marriage ceremony in the temple. What is this marriage ceremony? It is the combination of man and woman, boy and girl. They are already there they are living like friends—what is the use of this marriage ceremony? It is Vedic: the Vedas account for living together, sex life, but under some special regulations so that you may be happy. The ultimate end is to become happy. If you follow the Vedic rules and restrictions, that will not mean that you will be kept from eating or not allowed to sleep, not allowed to defend or to have sex life. It is not like that. Your bodily necessities are the same as those of the animals; the animals also eat, they also sleep, they also mate and also defend. So we require these things also. But the Vedas prescribe some regulations: you act in this way, so that you will not be unhappy. If you follow the regulation, ultimately the result will be that you will be free from the material entanglement."

      "text" : "This material life is not meant for the spirit soul. It is simply a misunderstanding that you want to enjoy this material life. But Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, gives us specific orders so that we can enjoy, in such a way that, at the end, we will understand that this is not our proper life—our proper life is spiritual. This human form of life is perfected as soon as we come to the understanding of spiritual existence—that I am Brahman. Otherwise, if I do not take care of my spiritual life, then the result is that I must live as the cats and dogs do. There is every possibility that my next life will be an animal life. And if, by chance or by a freak of nature, I get into animal life, then millions and millions of years will be required before again coming to this human form of life. So the human form of life is meant for self-realization, and the Vedas are the direction.  Now in the Bhagavad-gītā you will find that Kṛṣṇa says that to study or to follow the rules and regulations of the Vedas actually means to come to the understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also. So the Vedas give you the chance to gradually come to the point of understanding Kṛṣṇa, after many, many births. But the Bhāgavatam is called the essence of life, the ripened fruit of the Vedas, because the Bhāgavatam gives you directly what is needed in your life.  The Vedas are divided into four: Sāma, Ṛg, Atharva and Yajur. Then these are explained by the Purāṇas, of which there are eighteen. Then these are still further explained by the Upaniṣads, of which there are 108. The Upaniṣads are summarized in the Vedānta-sūtra, and the Vedānta-sūtra is still again explained by the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, by the same author. This is the process. So the Bhāgavatam is the essence of all Vedic knowledge.  Naimiṣāraṇya is a very famous and sacred forest in northern India, where all the ṛṣis, the sages, generally go to aid their spiritual advancement of life. This Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam was first discussed in this age in that forest. When it was discussed, the great saint Sūta Gosvāmī was asked by his audience: Now that Kṛṣṇa has gone back to His abode, with whom is transcendental knowledge now resting? This question was raised. The Bhagavad-gītā was spoken by Kṛṣṇa Himself, and it contains all descriptions of jñāna-yoga, karma-yoga, dhyāna-yoga and bhakti-yoga. Now this inquiry was made: Where can you get spiritual knowledge, now that Kṛṣṇa is gone? The answer was that Kṛṣṇa, having departed, has left us the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. It is the representation, the sound representation, of Kṛṣṇa. The Bhāgavatam is not different from Kṛṣṇa, as the Gītā is not different from Kṛṣṇa. They are absolute. Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's sound vibration are not different. Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's name are also not different. And Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's form, again, are not different. This is absolute. It requires realization."

      "text" : "This Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam are sound incarnations of Kṛṣṇa. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is also the literary incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, and it is the fruit of Vedic knowledge. You may have experience that there is a bird which is called a parrot. The parrot's body is green, and his beak is red. The specific qualification of the parrot is that whatever you say he can imitate. That parrot bird is touching the ripened fruit, and, naturally, if the fruit is ripened on the tree, it becomes very tasteful. Again, if the fruit is tasted by the parrot, it becomes still more tasteful. That is nature's way. So, here, it is said that this Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is just like the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge, and at the same time it is touched by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Sūta's spiritual master. Śuka means parrot in Sanskrit.  This Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam was first explained by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, though the author is his father, Vyāsa. Śukadeva was only sixteen years old when he was taught the Bhāgavatam, and he was illumined. He was already liberated in the impersonal concept of the Absolute, but after hearing the Bhāgavatam from his father, he became attracted by the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, and he became a preacher of the Bhāgavatam. First he explained it before Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the great king. A short history of Mahārāja Parīkṣit is that he was a very pious king, but unfortunately by some of his acts he was cursed by a brāhmaṇa boy to die within seven days. In those days if a brāhmaṇa should curse someone it would come true. They had the power to curse or give benediction.  So Parīkṣit understood that within a week he would have to die, and he prepared himself. He gave up his kingdom, entrusting it to his son, Mahārāja Janamejaya, and he detached himself from the family and sat down on the banks of the Ganges near Delhi. It was not exactly the Ganges; it was actually the Yamunā. There, because he was a great emperor, many learned sages came.  Parīkṣit now inquired from all the great sages present there: \"What is my duty? I am going to die within seven days; now what is my duty? You are all learned sages; please just prescribe for me.\" So someone said to practice yoga, some said to practice jñāna, the cultivation of knowledge; there were different opinions. But at that time Śukadeva Gosvāmī entered the forest, and although Śukadeva was only sixteen, he was so learned and reputed that all the old sages, including his father, Vyāsadeva, stood up to show him respect. He was so learned. So when he appeared, it was agreed. \"Here is Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Let him decide what to do. We appoint him as our representative.\""
    }, {
      "text" : "Śukadeva Gosvāmī was thus authorized to speak, and he was asked, \"What is my duty? I am very fortunate that you have come in this momentous hour. Kindly tell me what is my duty.\"  Śukadeva Gosvāmī said, \"All right, I shall explain to you the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\" Then everyone present agreed.  As the Bhāgavatam was first spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, it is therefore mentioned that as the parrot touches ripened fruit and it becomes even sweeter, so this Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, because it was touched first by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, has become still more tasteful.  The idea is that any Vedic literature, especially the Bhāgavatam or the Gītā, should be learned as spoken by a realized soul. Especially this literature, which is called Vaiṣṇava literature, should not be heard from a person who is not a devotee. This point I have several times stressed. Those who are nondevotees, those who are mental speculationists, those who are fruitive workers, those who are meditators or mystic yogīs, cannot explain the science of God. This is especially mentioned also by Sanātana Gosvāmī, another great saint; those who are not in devotional service, nongodly, those who have no faith in God—such persons should not be allowed to speak on the Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, or any literature which is in relationship with the Supreme Lord. So it is not that anybody can speak the Bhāgavatam or the Gītā and we will have to hear it. No. Sanātana Gosvāmī especially prohibits us: we should not hear of the Supreme Lord from one who is not purified.  One may ask, \"How can you taint the words of Kṛṣṇa, which are naturally transcendentally pure? What is the harm if we hear from the nondevotee?\" This question may be raised. The example given here is that milk is very nice and nutritious, but as soon as it is touched by a serpent it becomes poison immediately. The serpent is very envious. He bites and puts to death immediately, unnecessarily, and therefore is considered the cruelest animal amongst the living entities. In the śāstra nonviolence is recommended, as in every scripture, but the serpent and the scorpion are allowed to be killed. You cannot say that milk is so nutritious, and we can drink—what is the harm if it is touched by serpents? No—the result will be death. One should not hear at least the Bhagavad-gītā and the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from those who are not devotees of the Lord, who have no realization of God and who are envious of Him. Their touch renders it poison. The words of the Lord are always sublime, but as soon as they are touched by the serpent-like nondevotee, one should be very careful about hearing.  In the Bhāgavatam, it is indicated that as soon as Śukadeva touched it, it became delicious. This is the distinction. Basically it is the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge, but at the same time it has been touched by Śukadeva Gosvāmī.  The Lord is the supreme object of yoga and the reservoir of all transcendental pleasure; He reveals Himself only to His devotees and by the mercy of His devotees all can relish His intimate association."

Everyone, from the aquatics to the highest form of human being—from the ant up to Brahmā, the first creature of this universe—is searching for peace. That is the main objective. Lord Caitanya said that a person who is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only peaceful man because he has no demands. That is the special qualification of a person who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is akāmaḥ. Akāmaḥ refers to those who have no desire, who are self-sufficient, who have nothing to ask and who are fully peaceful. Who are they? They are the devotees who are situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  All others fall into three classes. One class is bhukti, those who are hankering after material happiness and enjoyment. These people want to eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. There are different modes of enjoyment according to the body. People are searching after sense enjoyment on this planet, on other planets, here, there and everywhere. Their main object is to gratify the senses. That is called bhukti. The next class is those people who are fatigued or frustrated in sense gratification and therefore want liberation from this material entanglement. And then there are those who, in search of knowledge, speculate about what the Absolute Truth is. Thus there are some who want sense enjoyment, and others, the salvationists, who are seeking liberation. The salvationists also have some desire, the desire to be free from this material entanglement. Then there are those who are yogīs; they are searching after mystic perfection. There are eight kinds of mystic perfection which grant the ability to become the smallest, to become the heaviest, or to get whatever one desires. Ordinary persons who are after sense gratification and those who are salvationists or who are after mystic perfection all have some demand. But what about the devotees? They have no demands. Because they simply want to serve Kṛṣṇa, they are waiting for the order of Kṛṣṇa, and that is their satisfaction. If Kṛṣṇa wants the devotees to go to hell, they are prepared to go to hell. And if Kṛṣṇa says, \"You come to Me,\" they are prepared to go. They have no demands. This is the perfectional stage.  There is a very nice verse in which a devotee prays: \"I shall simply be conscious of You, my dear Lord, Kṛṣṇa conscious, free from all mental demands.\" Actually, because we are in material bondage, we have many demands. Some people want sense gratification, those who are a little more elevated want mental satisfaction, and those who are still more refined want to show some magic jugglery of power in this world. They are all in material bondage in different capacities. Therefore, a person who is Kṛṣṇa conscious prays to the Lord: \"My dear Lord, when shall I be fully absorbed in Your thoughts or Your service?\" \"Your thoughts\" are not simply abstract, concocted speculation; it is a practical mode of thought. \"I shall become peaceful.\" All mental concoction—I want this, I want that—will be completely eradicated."
    }, {
      "text" : "We are hovering over the mental plane. We have given power of attorney to the mind, and the mind is driving us—\"Come here, go there.\" One has to stop such nonsense. \"I shall simply be Your eternal servitor. And I shall be very cheerful, for I have my master.\" All others who are not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are guideless. They are their own guides. The person who is Kṛṣṇa conscious has the supreme guide; therefore, he has no fear. For example, as long as a child is under the care of his parents he has no fear. But as soon as he becomes free, he finds many impediments. This is a crude example, but similarly, when one becomes completely free from all mental concoction and engages one hundred percent in Kṛṣṇa consciousness twenty-four hours a day, he will be peaceful at once. That is peace.  Therefore, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, because they have no demands, are actually peaceful. Those who are after sense enjoyment, salvation and yogic mystic perfection are always full of anxiety. As long as one is full of anxiety, one should know that he is still under the grip of material nature. And as soon as one is free from all anxiety, one should know that he is liberated. This fearful anxiety exists because we do not know Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, the supreme controller. Instead, we have other conceptions, and therefore we are always anxious.  There are many examples, such as Prahlāda Mahārāja. He was only five years old, a pet child, but because he was a devotee of the Lord, his father became his enemy. This is the way of the world. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord he finds so many obstacles. But those obstacles will not hinder one or be impediments on the path. We should always be personally prepared to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise, there is only the kingdom of māyā, illusion. Māyā will try to defeat us as soon as she sees, \"Oh, here is a living soul going out of my grip.\" As soon as one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious and fully surrenders unto the Supreme Lord, he has nothing more to fear from this illusion. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person is the perfectly peaceful person."

      "text" : "Everyone wants peace in the world. The peace marchers do not know how to obtain peace, but they want peace. I read a speech of the Archbishop of Canterbury in which he said, \"You want the kingdom of God without God.\" This is our defect. If you want peace at all, then accept that peace means to understand God. That is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā. Unless you are in touch with the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, you cannot have peace. Therefore, we have a different peace formula. The real peace formula is that one must know that God is the proprietor of all this universe, including the United States of America. He is the proprietor of Russia, He is the proprietor of China, He is the proprietor of India, of everything. But because we claim that we are the proprietors, there is fighting, there is discord, there is disagreement, and how can there be peace?  First of all, one has to accept that God is the proprietor of everything. We are simply guests for fifty or a hundred years. We come and go, and while one is here, he is absorbed in this thought: \"This is my land. This is my family. This is my body. This is my property.\" And when there is an order from the Supreme for one to leave his home, his property, his body, his family, his money and his bank balance and it is all gone, one has to take another place. We are under the grip of material nature, and she is offering different kinds of bodies: \"Now, my dear sir, you accept this body.\" We accept an American body, an Indian body, a Chinese body, a cat's body or a dog's body. I am not the Proprietor even of this body, yet I say that I am this body. Actually, this is ignorance. And how can one have peace? Peace can be had when one understands that God is the proprietor of everything. One's friends, one's mother, one's mother's father and the President are all guests of time. When this knowledge is accepted, then there will be peace.  We are searching for a friend to give us peace and tranquillity. That friend is Kṛṣṇa, God. Just make friendship with Him; you'll find everyone to be your friend. Because God is situated in everyone's heart, if you make friendship with God, He will dictate from within so that you will also be treated in a friendly way. If you make friendship with the police commissioner, you receive some advantage. H you make friendship with President Nixon, everyone will be your friend because everyone is under the President. If you want something from any officer, simply call President Nixon, and he will say, \"All right, look after this man.\" Everything is taken care of. Just try to have friendship with God, and everyone will be your friend. If all people understand this very nice fact, that God is everyone's friend and that He is the supreme proprietor, they will become peaceful. That is explained also by Lord Caitanya."
    }, {
      "text" : "In Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Caitanya-caritāmṛta, or any Vedic literature or any other literature in any other religion, the same fact is presented: God is the proprietor. God is the only friend. If you understand this, then you'll have peace. This is the peace formula. As soon as you encroach on God's Property, calling it your own, material nature, the police action, will be there: \"You are not the proprietor.\" You can simply have what is allotted to you by God.  Your business is to elevate yourself to perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness and nothing more. If you deviate from this law, if you don't accept this principle, if you want to enjoy more, then you have to suffer more. There is no question of forgetting. Therefore, Lord Caitanya says, \"One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious has no demands. Thus he is at peace.\"  Those in Kṛṣṇa consciousness do not know anything more than Kṛṣṇa. Actually only those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious are peaceful, unafraid of anything. They are neither in heaven nor in hell nor anywhere but with Kṛṣṇa, so for them everything is Vaikuṇṭha, without fear. Similarly, Lord Kṛṣṇa as Paramātmā, Supersoul, lives everywhere. He lives in the heart of a hog also. The hog eats stool, but that does not mean that because the Supreme Lord is in the heart of the hog, He is also subjected to such punishment. The Lord and His devotees are always transcendental to the modes of material nature. Persons who are completely Kṛṣṇa conscious are very rare and very peaceful. Out of millions and millions of people, it is very difficult to find one who is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious; this position of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so rare. But Kṛṣṇa Himself, as Lord Caitanya, seeing the pitiable condition of the present day, is directly giving free love of Godhead.  Yet because love of God is being given freely and so easily, people do not care for it. My spiritual master used to say that if you take a langera mango, which is a first-class, topmost quality mango in India, very costly, very sweet and very tasteful, and go from door to door and try to distribute it freely, people will doubt: \"Why has this man brought this langera mango? Why is he trying to distribute it freely? There must be some motive behind it.\" Similarly, Lord Caitanya distributed this Kṛṣṇa consciousness langera mango very cheaply, but people are so foolish that they think, \"Oh, they are simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa; what is there to it? This is meant for the foolish, who cannot speculate and do not have any higher standard of knowledge.\" But that is not so. It is said: \"Out of millions and millions of people, only a few are interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\" Do not neglect this information; it is very rare, and if you practice Kṛṣṇa consciousness, your life will be successful. Your mission in human life will be fulfilled. This seed of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very rare and very valuable. Lord Caitanya said that innumerable living entities are wandering and transmigrating in the 8,400,000 species of life, one after another. Out of so many, one may come who is fortunate, who has spiritual fortune."
    }, {
      "text" : "Sometimes devotees of the Lord go from door to door. Their policy is to go as beggars. So in India, beggars, especially sannyāsīs, are very much respected. If a sannyāsī comes to a house to beg, he is very well received: \"Swamījī, what can I do for you?\" The devotee beggar won't ask for anything, but whatever one can give, even one capātī, makes one spiritually rich. That man who offers a capātī to a pure devotee who comes to his door is made spiritually rich. When one is advanced in spiritual wealth, he offers a good reception to devotees as far as possible. According to the Vedic system, even if your enemy comes to your house, you have to receive him in such a way that you will forget that he is your enemy. That is the general system for receiving a pure devotee who has sacrificed everything for the Lord.  These are instructions for householders. The householder should come out of his home during noontime and call out for anyone who is hungry to please come and take the food. Only if no one comes in answer to his call can the chief of the household take his meals. There are so many rules and regulations just to train a man to become godly. They are not superstitious or superfluous. The human being should be trained to be godly. Because he is part and parcel of God, he is given the chance to be trained. This training is given because some day or other the person may be Kṛṣṇa conscious.  If by chance during this training he meets a teacher who is a saintly person and a pure devotee of the Lord, then by such a contact he becomes pure. Therefore, Lord Caitanya said that the fortunate person who has had some spiritual asset in his past dealings will seek the association of a pure devotee. The seed of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is received by the mercy of guru, the spiritual master, and by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. When the spiritual master and Lord Kṛṣṇa will that a person must have Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the seed very nicely fructifies. That spiritual asset makes one fortunate, and thus he becomes spiritually enlivened, and then he meets a bona fide spiritual master, and, by the grace of the spiritual master, he can receive the seed of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is his inner urge: \"Where can I get this association? Where can I get this awareness?\""
    }, {
      "text" : "This process is recommended; it is the general process of spiritual advancement. Kṛṣṇa is within you, and as soon as Kṛṣṇa sees that you are very sincere, that you are seeking, He sends a bona fide spiritual master. This combination of Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master is the cause of one's receiving the seed of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The seed is there. If you have a very nice seed of a rose bush, what is your duty? If you have a seed of any nice plant, it is your duty not to lock it up in the safety vault of a bank. Your duty is to sow it in the ground. Where should you sow that seed? If you have information of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you just sow it in your heart. Not in this earth, but in the earth within yourself. And after sowing a seed you have to pour a little water on it, so that water is hearing and chanting. Once the seed is sown in the heart, just pour on a little water, and it will grow.  This process should not be stopped by the thought that because one is initiated there is no need of hearing and chanting. It should go on continuously. If you stop pouring water on a plant, it will dry up, it will not produce any fruit. Similarly, even if you are highly elevated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you cannot stop this process of hearing and chanting because māyā is so strong, so powerful, that as soon as she sees, \"Ah, here is an opportunity,\" at once you will dry up. By the process of pouring water, that plant of Kṛṣṇa consciousness grows. How does it grow? There is a limit to every plant you see; it grows and grows and grows, but there is a limit where it stops growing. But the plant of Kṛṣṇa consciousness grows in such a way that it does not rest in any part of this material universe because a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not satisfied with planetary facilities in any part of this material universe. Even if you offer him Siddhaloka, where the inhabitants are so powerful and elevated that they can fly in the sky without airplanes, he will not be satisfied.  There is a planet, Siddhaloka, according to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, where the inhabitants do not need airplanes or spacecraft to fly from one planet to another. Above Siddhaloka there are many other planets. I saw that the latest modern opinion is that every star is a sun, and there are different planetary systems, solar systems; but according to Vedic literature there are innumerable universes which are separate identities. The limit of this universe is the outermost sky. The modern scientist says that each and every star is a sun. But Vedic literature does not say that. Vedic literature informs us that there is only one sun in each universe, but there are innumerable universes, and thus there are innumerable suns and moons. The highest planet of this universe is called Brahmaloka. And Lord Kṛṣṇa says, \"Even if you approach the highest planet, you have to come back again.\" Sputniks and astronauts are going very high, and here on earth people are clapping; but after just a brief time they come down again. However one may clap, he cannot do more than that. Similarly, those who are materialistic can go high up to Brahmaloka where Brahmā is, but those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious will reject even that. They neglect even the impersonal brahma-jyotir. They don't care for it."

      "text" : "The covering of this universe is far, far greater than this space which we are now in. The outside of the universe is ten times the space within, so one has to penetrate that covering, and then reach Virajā, the Causal Ocean. The Buddhist philosophical perfection is to reach that Virajā. When this material existence is completely finished, it is called virajā, according to Vedic language. But the Kṛṣṇa conscious person not only penetrates the covering of this universe, but after he reaches that Causal Ocean, which is the neutral position, he continues. The plant grows so nicely from Brahmaloka to Virajā to the spiritual sky, and even when that plant reaches the spiritual sky, it is not satisfied with any Vaikuṇṭha planet.  The highest planet in the spiritual sky is Kṛṣṇaloka. It is just like a lotus flower, where Kṛṣṇa is standing. And there, when the plant finds Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, it rests. Just as a creeper grows and grows and grows and at last attaches itself to something and then expands, when the devotional plant gets to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, it expands. As soon as this Kṛṣṇa consciousness creeper captures Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, it takes shelter. \"There. Now I have finished my journey. Let me expand here.\" To expand means to enjoy Kṛṣṇa's association. There the devotees are satisfied.  That creeper has to go on, and thus those who are already in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if they have their natural growth, relish the fruit of that creeper even in this life.  If you continue this chanting and hearing process, you will grow and grow and actually reach Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet and there relish His association."

    "description" : "In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Sri Krishna, the original spiritual master, tells His disciple Arjuna, “The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” In other words, a genuine guru must have realized the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, and he must be able to impart this truth to his disciple, thus freeing him (or her) from repeated birth and death.\n\nA guru is a person who had personally assimilated all the essence of the Vedic literatures and can help his disciples or followers to adopt the ways. A guru is the one who gives spiritual protection and guidance to people. \n\nFrom Darkness to Light \n\nThe guru's business is to bring his disciples from darkness to light and see that no human being suffers in this material world.\nIn this material world, there are three kinds of suffering: these are miseries arising from the material body and mind, from other living entities and from the forces of nature. Everyone is suffering from one, two or three of them. No one can say that he is completely free from suffering. We may then ask why the living entity is suffering. The answer is: out of ignorance.\n\nTherefore the guru's first business is to rescue his disciple from this ignorance. We send our children to school to save them from suffering. If our children do not receive an education, we fear that they will suffer in the future. The guru sees that suffering is due to ignorance, which is compared to darkness. How can one in darkness be saved? By light. The guru takes the torchlight of knowledge and presents it before the living entity enveloped in darkness. That knowledge relieves him from the sufferings of the darkness of ignorance.\n\nGuru is One\n\nThe guru is one because he comes in disciplic succession. What Vyasadeva and Krishna taught 5,000 years ago is also being taught now. There is no difference between the two instructions. Although hundreds and thousands of acaryas have come and gone, the message is one. The real guru cannot be two because the real guru does not speak differently from his predecessors.\n\nFive thousand years ago Lord Sri Krsna spoke Bhagavad-gita, and Vyasadeva recorded it. Srila Vyasadeva did not say, \"This is my opinion.\" Rather, he wrote, sri bhagavan uvaca, that is, \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead says.\" Whatever Vyasadeva wrote was originally spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srila Vyasadeva did not give his own opinion.\n\nConsequently, Srila Vyasadeva is a guru. He does not misinterpret the words of Krsna but transmits them exactly as they were spoken. If we send a telegram, the person who delivers the telegram does not have to correct it, edit it or add to it. He simply presents it. That is the guru's business. The guru may be this person or that, but the message is the same; therefore it is said that guru is one.\n\nThe bona fide guru will simply present what the supreme guru, God, says in bona fide scripture. A guru cannot change the message of the disciplic succession.\n\nNo Research Necessary\nWe must understand that we cannot carry out research to find the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-gita Sri Krsna says: \"This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.\" (Bg. 4.2)\n\nTaking on a guru is not simply a fashion. One who is serious about understanding spiritual life requires a guru. A guru is a question of necessity, for one must be very serious to understand spiritual life, God, proper action and one's relationship with God. When we are very serious about understanding these subjects, we need a guru. We shouldn't go to a guru simply because a guru may be fashionable at the moment. Surrender must be there, for without surrender we cannot learn anything. If we go to a guru simply to challenge him, we will learn nothing. \n\nBut we must accept the guru just as Arjuna accepted his guru, Sri Krsna Himself: \"Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.\" (Bg. 2.7).\n\nKrishna is original spiritual master. Some 5000 years ago when he appeared on this planet, he accepted Sandipani Muni as His spiritual master. Krishna, along with His brother Balaram, strictly followed the rules and regulation of a disciple and followed the instruction of Their spiritual master, Sandipani Muni, who was a resident of Avantipura, in the northern Indian district of Ujjain. Thus, Sandipani Muni and Lord Krishna set an example of the perfect guru and perfect disciple respectively.  \n\n",

Accompanied by Lord Balarāma and surrounded by the cowherd boys and the cows, Lord Krishna entered the forest of Vṛndāvana as He played His flute. Decorating themselves with newly grown leaves, along with peacock feathers, garlands, clusters of flower buds, and colored minerals, Balarāma, Krishna and Their cowherd friends danced, wrestled and sang.

The boys, pretending they were machines, would sometimes whirl about until they became dizzy. They would also sometimes jump about. Sometimes they would hurl objects like balls or stones and sometimes they would grab each other by the arms and throw one another about. Sometimes they would slap one another’s shoulders or backs. They would drag one another about in the midst of their play.   They would engage in arm wrestling and other types of friendly fighting and Krishna and Balarāma would sometimes grab the hair on the other boys’ heads in a playful manner.",

Very good!”  Sometimes the cowherd boys would play with bilva or kumbha fruits, and sometimes with handfuls of āmalaka fruits. The boys would play with fruits by throwing a few in the air and then throwing others to try to hit them.   At other times they would play the games of trying to touch one another or of trying to identify somebody while one is blindfolded. One boy would approach a blindfolded boy from behind and place his palms over the blindfolded boy’s eyes. Then, simply by the feel of his palms, the blindfolded boy would have to guess who the other boy was. In all such games the boys put up stakes for the winner, such as flutes or walking sticks.

They would sometimes jump around like frogs, sometimes play various jokes, sometimes ride in swings and sometimes imitate monarchs.

In fact, performers of sacrifices are undoubtedly born in this world again whereas those who offer obeisances to Lord Krishna never experience birth in the material world again.” Skanda Purana.  \"My dear Lord, one who constantly waits for Your causeless mercy to be bestowed upon him and who goes on suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds, offering You respectful obeisances from the core of his heart, is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim.\" (SrimadBhagavatam 10.14.8)",

    "text1" : "Vedic scriptures explain that the one who possess all six opulence can be called God of Bhagavan. God or Bhagavan is understood to be as one who is full of these six opulences – who has full strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty, and renunciation. Vedas further explain that the one person who possess all these six opulence in full is Krishna. We can take each of the six opulence and see how Krishna possess that opulence in fullest:  1.\tWealth: Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality, is the proprietor of all riches. There are many rich men in the world, but no one can claim that he possesses all the wealth. Nor can anyone claim that no one is richer than he. We understand from the Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, that when Krishna was present on this earth He had 16,108 wives, and each wife lived in a palace made of marble and bedecked with jewels. The rooms were filled with furniture made of ivory and gold, and there was great opulence everywhere. These descriptions are all given vividly in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.  In the history of human society we cannot find anyone who had sixteen thousand wives or sixteen thousand palaces. Nor did Krishna go to one wife one day and another wife another day.  He was personally present in every palace at the same time. This means that He expanded Himself in 16,108 forms. This is impossible for an ordinary man, but it is not very difficult for God. If God is unlimited, He can expand Himself in unlimited forms; otherwise there is no meaning to the word unlimited. God is omnipotent; He can maintain not only sixteen thousand wives but sixteen million and still encounter no difficulty; otherwise there is no meaning to the word omnipotent.  These are all attractive features. We experience in this material world that if a man is very rich, he is attractive. ",
    "text2" : "2.\tStrength: Krishna has unlimited strength. His strength was present from the moment of His birth. When Krishna was only three months old, the Putana demon attempted to kill Him, but instead she was killed by Krishna. That is God. God is God from the beginning. He does not become God by some meditation or mystic power. Krishna is not that type of God. Krishna was God from the very beginning of His appearance.  3.\tFame: Krishna also has unlimited fame. Many millions in the world are aware of the fame of the Bhagavad-gita, which was spoken by Krishna to His friend Arjuna. In all countries all over the world the Bhagavad-gita is read by philosophers, psychologists, and religionists. The fame of the Bhagavad-gita is Krishna’s fame. ",
    "text3" : "4.\t4) Beauty:  Beauty, another opulence, is possessed unlimitedly by Krishna. Krishna Himself is very beautiful, as are all His associates. In this world one is attracted to people and countries which are rich, beautiful, knowledgeable, advanced and possess many attractive material characteristics.   One can just imagine how many attractive features must be possessed by God, who is the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation. How beautiful He must be – He who has created all beauty.   5.\t5)Knowledge:  A person is attractive not only because of his beauty, but also because of his knowledge. A scientist or philosopher may be attractive because of his knowledge, but what knowledge is more sublime than that given by Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita? There is no comparison in the world to such knowledge which elevates the body, mind and soul. ",
    "text4" : "6.\t6) Renunciation:  Despite possessing the various opulences like name, fame, beauty, etc., Krishna also possesses full renunciation. So many things are working under Krishna’s direction in this material world, but actually Krishna is not present here. A big factory may continue to work, although the owner may not be present. Similarly, Krishna’s potencies are working under the direction of His assistants, the demigods. Thus Krishna Himself is aloof from the material world.  In conclusion:  Vedic scriptures like Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam further explain why Krishna is Bhagavan or God and one can read these scriptures to delve further into this subject matter. It is concluded in the Brahma-samhita (Verse 5.1) by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavan, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes. ",

Without the spirit, the body is motionless, or dead.

Nor is the person to whom we are rendering that service satisfi Thus, we can understand that on the material platform, everyone is frustrated. The reason for this is that the service being rendered is not properly directed.   For example, if we want to render service to a tree, we must water the root. If we pour water on the leaves, branches, and twigs, there is little benefit. benefit. If the Supreme Personality of Godhead is served, all other parts and parcels will be automatically satisfied. Consequently, all welfare activities as well as service to society, family, and nation are realized by serving the Supreme Lord. ",

Brahman:  The Absolute Truth can be realized as the impersonal all-pervasive spirit.

Having been sent by the cruel King Kamsa to kill all the babies in the Vrndavana area, Putana displayed her mystic power and assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. She boldly entered Krsna's bedroom without permission, but everyone was so overwhelmed by her beauty that they did not protest. The baby Krsna, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon Putana and thought that He would have to kill her. Putana could understand the great potency of Krsna, but, enchanted by the influence of Krsna's internal energy, she took Krsna upon her lap anyway and offered Him her poison smeared breast to suck. Suddenly baby Krsna became very angry at Putana, and taking hold of her breast, He squeezed it very hard with both hands and began to suck out both poison and her life. In unbearable agony, Putana perspired heavily, flailed her arms and legs wildly, and cried out, \"Please leave me, leave me! Suck my breast no longer!\" But Krsna persisted, and as the demoness lost her life, she assumed her original, huge form. Then before the amazed gopis, Krsna began fearlessly playing on the breast of Putana's twelve-mile-long corpse. Srimad Bhagavatam 10.6",

      "description" : "In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Sri Krishna, the original spiritual master, tells His disciple Arjuna, “The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” In other words, a genuine guru must have realized the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, and he must be able to impart this truth to his disciple, thus freeing him (or her) from repeated birth and death.\n\nA guru is a person who had personally assimilated all the essence of the Vedic literatures and can help his disciples or followers to adopt the ways. A guru is the one who gives spiritual protection and guidance to people. \n\nFrom Darkness to Light \n\nThe guru's business is to bring his disciples from darkness to light and see that no human being suffers in this material world.\nIn this material world, there are three kinds of suffering: these are miseries arising from the material body and mind, from other living entities and from the forces of nature. Everyone is suffering from one, two or three of them. No one can say that he is completely free from suffering. We may then ask why the living entity is suffering. The answer is: out of ignorance.\n\nTherefore the guru's first business is to rescue his disciple from this ignorance. We send our children to school to save them from suffering. If our children do not receive an education, we fear that they will suffer in the future. The guru sees that suffering is due to ignorance, which is compared to darkness. How can one in darkness be saved? By light. The guru takes the torchlight of knowledge and presents it before the living entity enveloped in darkness. That knowledge relieves him from the sufferings of the darkness of ignorance.\n\nGuru is One\n\nThe guru is one because he comes in disciplic succession. What Vyasadeva and Krishna taught 5,000 years ago is also being taught now. There is no difference between the two instructions. Although hundreds and thousands of acaryas have come and gone, the message is one. The real guru cannot be two because the real guru does not speak differently from his predecessors.\n\nFive thousand years ago Lord Sri Krsna spoke Bhagavad-gita, and Vyasadeva recorded it. Srila Vyasadeva did not say, \"This is my opinion.\" Rather, he wrote, sri bhagavan uvaca, that is, \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead says.\" Whatever Vyasadeva wrote was originally spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srila Vyasadeva did not give his own opinion.\n\nConsequently, Srila Vyasadeva is a guru. He does not misinterpret the words of Krsna but transmits them exactly as they were spoken. If we send a telegram, the person who delivers the telegram does not have to correct it, edit it or add to it. He simply presents it. That is the guru's business. The guru may be this person or that, but the message is the same; therefore it is said that guru is one.\n\nThe bona fide guru will simply present what the supreme guru, God, says in bona fide scripture. A guru cannot change the message of the disciplic succession.\n\nNo Research Necessary\nWe must understand that we cannot carry out research to find the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-gita Sri Krsna says: \"This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.\" (Bg. 4.2)\n\nTaking on a guru is not simply a fashion. One who is serious about understanding spiritual life requires a guru. A guru is a question of necessity, for one must be very serious to understand spiritual life, God, proper action and one's relationship with God. When we are very serious about understanding these subjects, we need a guru. We shouldn't go to a guru simply because a guru may be fashionable at the moment. Surrender must be there, for without surrender we cannot learn anything. If we go to a guru simply to challenge him, we will learn nothing. \n\nBut we must accept the guru just as Arjuna accepted his guru, Sri Krsna Himself: \"Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.\" (Bg. 2.7).\n\nKrishna is original spiritual master. Some 5000 years ago when he appeared on this planet, he accepted Sandipani Muni as His spiritual master. Krishna, along with His brother Balaram, strictly followed the rules and regulation of a disciple and followed the instruction of Their spiritual master, Sandipani Muni, who was a resident of Avantipura, in the northern Indian district of Ujjain. Thus, Sandipani Muni and Lord Krishna set an example of the perfect guru and perfect disciple respectively.  \n\n",

      "description" : "One day the demoness Putana descended from outer space into Gokula, the home of Nanda Maharaja. Having been sent by the cruel King Kamsa to kill all the babies in the Vrndavana area, Putana displayed her mystic power and assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. She boldly entered Krsna's bedroom without permission, but everyone was so overwhelmed by her beauty that they did not protest. The baby Krsna, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon Putana and thought that He would have to kill her. Putana could understand the great potency of Krsna, but, enchanted by the influence of Krsna's internal energy, she took Krsna upon her lap anyway and offered Him her poison smeared breast to suck. Suddenly baby Krsna became very angry at Putana, and taking hold of her breast, He squeezed it very hard with both hands and began to suck out both poison and her life. In unbearable agony, Putana perspired heavily, flailed her arms and legs wildly, and cried out, \"Please leave me, leave me! Suck my breast no longer!\" But Krsna persisted, and as the demoness lost her life, she assumed her original, huge form. Then before the amazed gopis, Krsna began fearlessly playing on the breast of Putana's twelve-mile-long corpse. Srimad Bhagavatam 10.6",

Therefore, upon hearing this omen from the sky, he caught hold of his cousin's hair with his left hand and took up his sword with his right hand to sever her head.   Wanting to pacify Kamsa, the great soul Vasudeva spoke to him in the following words: \"\"My dear Kamsa, you are the pride of your family, the Bhoja dynasty, and great heroes praise your qualities.

Perhaps Kamsa will die before my sons take birth, or, since he is already destined to die at the hands of my son, one of my sons may kill him. For the time being, let me promise to hand over my sons so that Kamsa will give up this immediate threat, and if, in due course of time, Kamsa dies, I shall have nothing to fear.\"\" Vasudeva submitted this proposal to the sinful Kamsa with great respect. Kamsa agreed to the logical arguments of Vasudeva, and having full faith in Vasudeva's words, he refrained from killing his cousin.

    "description" : "\"Vasudeva and Devaki were within prison of Kamsa (brother of Devaki) when Lord Krishna, in His Visnu form, appeared before them as their son. He appeared from the heart of Devaki in the dense darkness of night, like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon, the new-born child had very wonderful lotus-petal eyes and bore in His four hands a conch shell, disc, club, and lotus. On His chest was the mark of Srivatsa, and on His neck the brilliant Vasudeva could understand that the child was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Having concluded this without a doubt, he became fearless.  Bowing down with folded hands, he offered prayers to the child, who illuminated His birthplace with His natural effulgence. Next Vasudeva's wife Devaki offered her prayers. The Lord, being very pleased by the prayers of His parents, responded,\"\" 0 My dear mother and father, I appeared twice before as your son because I found no one else as highly elevated as you in simplicity and other good qualities. Both of you should constantly think of Me as your son, but you should always know that I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By thus thinking of Me constantly with love and affection, you will achieve the highest perfection: returning home, back to Godhead.\"\" After thus instructing His father and mother, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, transformed Himself into a small human child.

    "description" : "When Kaṁsa was killed, his two queens, Asti and Prapti, went to their father’s house in great distress. The sorrowful queens told their father, King Jarāsandha of Magadha, all about how they had become widows. Hearing this odious news, Jarāsandha was filled with sorrow and anger, and he began the greatest possible endeavor to rid the earth of the members of Yadava dynasty. He laid siege to the Yadu capital, Mathurā, on all sides.            Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, when He descended to the earth He played the role of a human being. Thus when He saw Jarāsandha’s assembled army surrounding His city  and how this army was striking fear into His subjects, the Lord considered what His suitable response should be according to the time, place and specific purpose of His current incarnation.            The Supreme Lord thought: Since it is such a burden on the earth, I will destroy Jarāsandha’s army, consisting of foot soldiers, horses, chariots and elephants, which the King of Magadha has assembled from all subservient kings and brought together here. But Jarāsandha himself should not be killed, since in the future he will certainly assemble another army.          “This is the purpose of My present incarnation — to relieve the earth of its burden, protect the pious and kill the impious”,  as Lord Govinda was thinking in this way, two chariots suddenly descended from Lord’s own abode, Vaikunta-loka. They were complete with drivers and equipment. The Lord’s eternal divine weapons also appeared before Him spontaneously.             Seeing these, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, addressed his brother, Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa. He said: My respected elder brother, see this danger which has beset Your dependents, the Yadus! And see, dear master, how Your personal chariot and favorite weapons have come before You. The purpose for which We have taken birth, My Lord, is to secure the welfare of Our devotees. Please now remove from the earth the burden of these twenty-three armies.   ",

    "description" : " Lord Krishna and his brother Balarama, wearing armor and displaying Their resplendent weapons, drove out of the city of Mathura in Their chariots to attack the army of Jarasandha with only a very small contingent of soldiers accompanied Them. As Lord Krishna came out of the city of Mathura, He blew His conchshell, and the enemy soldiers’ hearts began to tremble with fear.             Just as the wind covers the sun with clouds or a fire with dust, the son of Jara marched toward the two brothers and with his huge assemblage of armies surrounded Them and Their soldiers, chariots, flags, horses and charioteers.               Seeing His army tormented by the relentless and savage rain of arrows from the massive opposing forces, Lord Hari twanged His excellent bow, Saranga. Lord Krishna took arrows from His quiver, fixed them on the bowstring, pulled back, and released endless torrents of sharp shafts, which struck the enemy’s chariots, elephants, horses and infantrymen. The Lord shooting His arrows resembled a blazing circle of fire.                         Elephants fell to the ground, their foreheads split open, cavalry horses fell with severed necks, chariots fell with their horses, flags, drivers and masters all shattered, and foot soldiers collapsed with severed arms, thighs and shoulders. Jarasandha, with his chariot lost and all his soldiers dead, was left with only his breath. At that point Lord Balarāma forcibly seized the powerful warrior, just as one lion takes hold of another. With the divine noose of Varuṇa and other, mortal ropes, Balarama began tying up Jarasandha, who had killed so many foes. But Lord Govinda still had a purpose to fulfill through Jarasandha, and thus He asked Balarama to stop.                                  Jarasandha, whom fighters had highly honored, was ashamed after being released by the two Lords of the universe, and thus he decided to undergo penances. On the road, however, several kings convinced him with both spiritual wisdom and mundane arguments that he should give up his idea of self-abnegation. All of his armies having been killed, and himself neglected by the Personality of Godhead, King Jarasandha, then sadly returned to the kingdom of the Magadhas.                                  Seventeen times the King of Magadha met defeat in this very way. And yet throughout these defeats he fought on with his army divisions against the forces of the Yadu dynasty who were protected by Sri Krishna. By the power of Lord Krishna, the members of the Vrisnis would invariably annihilate all of Jarasandha’s forces, and when all his soldiers had been killed, the King, released by his enemies, would again go away.

    "description" : "Kalayavana a barbarian warrior sent by Narada, saw that Krishna’s brilliantly effulgent body matched Narada’s description of the Lord, and thus He knew that Krishna was the Supreme Lord.                        Seeing that the Lord carried no weapons, Kalayavana put his own weapons aside and ran toward Him from behind, wanting to fight with Him. Sri Krishna ran from him, staying just barely beyond Kalayavana’s grasp at every step and eventually leading him a long distance toward a mountain cave. As Kalayavana ran, he hurled insults at the Lord, but he could not grasp Him.                Sri Krishna entered the cave, whereupon Kalayavana followed after Him and saw a man lying on the ground. Taking him for Sri Krishna, Kalayavana kicked him. The man had been sleeping for a very long time, and now, having been violently awakened, he looked around angrily in all directions and saw Kalayavana. The man stared harshly at him, igniting a fire in Kalayavana’s body and in a moment burning him to ashes.          This extraordinary person was a son of Mandhata’s named Mucukunda. He was devoted to brahminical culture and always true to his vow. Previously, he had spent many long years helping to protect the demigods from the demons. When the demigods had eventually obtained Karttikeya their protector, they allowed Mucukunda to retire, offering him any boon other than liberation, which only Lord Vishnu can bestow. Mucukunda had chosen from the demigods the benediction of being covered by sleep, and thus since then he had been lying asleep within the cave.          Upon Kalayavana’s immolation, Sri Krishna showed Himself to Mucukunda, who was struck with wonder at seeing Krishna’s incomparable beauty. Mucukunda asked Lord Krishna who He was and also explained to the Lord his own identity. Mucukunda said, “After growing weary from remaining awake for a long time, I was enjoying my sleep here in this cave when some stranger disturbed me and, suffering the reaction of his sins, was burnt to ashes. O Lord, O vanquisher of all enemies, it is my great fortune that I now have the vision of Your beautiful form.”         Lord Sri Krishna then told Mucukunda who He was and offered him a boon. The wise Mucukunda, understanding the futility of material life, asked only that he might be allowed to take shelter of Lord Sri Krishna’s lotus feet. ",

    "description" : "Jarasandha again attacked Mathura, this time with bigger divisions of soldiers. Lord Śrī Krishna wanted to save Mathura from the eighteenth attack of the great military divisions of King Jarasandha. To prevent further killing of soldiers and to attend to other important business, Lord Krishna left the battlefield without fighting.             Actually He was not at all afraid, but He pretended to be an ordinary human being frightened by the immense quantity of soldiers and resources of Jarasandha. Without any weapons Krishna left the battlefield. Although His lotus feet were as soft as the petals of a lotus flower, He proceeded for a very long distance on foot.           This time, Jarasandha thought that Krishna and Balarama were very much afraid of his military strength and were fleeing the battlefield. He followed Them with all his chariots, horses and infantry. He thought Krishna and Balarama to be ordinary human beings, and he was trying to measure the activities of the Lord.         Due to this pastime Krishna is known as Ranacora, which means “one who has left the battlefield.” Krishna, the Ranacorajī, left the battlefield not because He was afraid but because He had some other purpose. The purpose, as it will be revealed, was to attend to a confidential letter sent by Rukmiṇi, His future first wife. Krishna’s leaving the battlefield is a display of one of His six opulences, renunciation.              After traversing a very long distance, the brothers pretended to become tired. To mitigate Their weariness, They climbed up  the Pravarsana mountain many miles above sea level. Jarasandha took it for granted that the two brothers were afraid of his military power and had hidden Themselves at the top of the mountain. First he tried to find Them, searching for a long time, but when he failed he decided to trap and kill Them by setting fires around the peak. He therefore surrounded the peak with firewood and set it ablaze.          As the fire spread more and more, Krishna and Balarama jumped from the top of the mountain down to the ground—a distance of eighty-eight miles. Thus, while the peak was burning up, Krishna and Balarama escaped, unseen by Jarasandha or his men. Jarasandha concluded that the two brothers had burned to ashes and that there was no need of further fighting.       Thinking himself successful in his efforts, Jarasandha left the city of Mathura and returned to his home in the kingdom of Magadha. Gradually Krishna and Balarama reached the city of Dvārakā, which was surrounded by the sea.  ",

Nanda Maharaja gave two millions cows, fully decorated with cloth and jewels, in charity to the brahmanas, He also gave them seven hills of grain covered with jewels and with cloth decorated with golden embroidery. Vrajapura, the residence of Nanda Maharaja, was fully decorated with various festoons and flags, and in various places there were gates made with varieties of flower garlands, pieces of cloth, and mango leaves. The courtyards, the great near the roads, and everything within the rooms of the houses were perfectly swept and washed with water. The cowherd men put on valuable ornaments and garments such as coats and turbans. Decorated in this way, and carrying various presentations in their hands, they approached the house of Nanda Maharaja.  The wives of the cowherd men were very pleased to hear that mother Yasoda had given birth to a son, and they decorated themselves very nicely with proper garments, ornaments, black ointment for the eyes, etc. With their lotus like faces looking extraordinarily beautiful, decorated as they were with saffron and fresh kunkuma, the wives of the cowherd men hurried to the house of mother Yasoda with presentations in their hands. Offering blessings to the newborn child, Krishna, the wives and daughters of the cowherd men said, \"\"May you become the King of Vraja and long maintain all its inhabitants.\"\" Then they sprinkled a mixture of turmeric powder, oil, and water upon the Supreme Lord and offered him prayers.

    "description" : "\"One day the demoness Putana descended from outer space into Gokula, the home of Nanda Maharaja. Having been sent by the cruel King Kamsa to kill all the babies in the Vrndavana area, Putana displayed her mystic power and assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. She boldly entered Krishna's bedroom without permission, but everyone was so overwhelmed by her beauty that they did not protest.   The baby Krishna, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon Putana and thought that He would have to kill her. Putana could understand the great potency of Krishna, but, enchanted by the influence of Krishna's internal energy, she took Krishna upon her lap anyway and offered Him her poison smeared breast to suck.  Suddenly baby Krishna became very angry at Putana, and taking hold of her breast, He squeezed it very hard with both hands and began to suck out both poison and her life. In unbearable agony, Putana perspired heavily, flailed her arms and legs wildly, and cried out, \"\"Please leave me, leave me! Suck my breast no longer!\"\" But Krishna persisted, and as the demoness lost her life, she assumed her original, huge form. Then before the amazed gopis (milkmaids of Vrindavan), Krishna began fearlessly playing on the breast of Putana's twelve-mile-long corpse. Source: Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 6 \"",

He picked up the child Krishna on his shoulders and raised a great dust storm all over Vrindavan, covering everyone’s eyes.  The Trnavarta demon went high into the sky with baby Krishna on his shoulder, but the baby assumed such a weight that suddenly he could not go any further, and he had to stop his whirlwind activities. Due to Krishna’s weight, Trnavatra considered him to be like a great mountain or a hunk of iron. But because Krishna had caught the demon's neck, the demon was unable to throw Him off. He therefore thought of the child as wonderful, since he could neither bear the child nor cast aside the burden. With Krishna grasping him by the throat, Trnavarta choked, unable even to make a sound or move his hands and legs. His eyes popping out, the demon lost his life and fell, along with the little boy, down to the ground of Vrndavana.  While the gopis who had gathered were crying for Krishna, the demon, fell from the sky onto a big slab of stone, his limbs dislocated. The gopis immediately picked Krishna up from the demon’s chest and delivered Him to mother Yasoda. Because the child was unhurt and now free from all danger and misfortune, the gopis and cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja, were extremely happy.  Srimad Bhagavatam Canto10, Chapter 7 ",

Her eyes fearful, she spoke to her son as follows: \"\" Dear Krishna, why are You so restless that You have eaten dirt in a solitary place?\"\" Lord Krishna replied, \"\"My dear mother, I have never eaten dirt. All My friends complaining against Me are liars. If you think they are being truthful, you can directly look into My mouth and examine it.\"\" Mother Yasoda challenged Krishna: “If you have not eaten earth, then open Your mouth wide.\"\" When Krishna was ordered by His mother, He immediately opened His mouth just like an ordinary boy. Then mother Yasoda saw within His mouth the complete opulence of creation. She saw outer space in all directions, mountains, islands, oceans, seas, planets, air, fire, moon and stars. Indeed, mother Yasoda saw within the mouth of her child everything necessary for the cosmic manifestation. Upon seeing all this, she became struck with awe and wondered whether she was dreaming or actually seeing something extraordinary.  Then Lord Krishna expanded His internal energy, and Yasoda forgot all philosophical speculation and accepted Krishna once again as her own child. Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10, Chap 8 \"",

Sometimes, imitating an ordinary child, He would pretend to be frightened by others and immediately hurry to His mother for protection. Sometimes He would fall into the clay and mud of Vrindavan and would approach His mother smeared with clay and saffron. He had been smeared with saffron and sandalwood pulp by His mother, but due to crawling over muddy clay He would also smear His body with clay. As soon as He would come crawling to His mother, Yasoda would take Him on her lap and allow Him to suck her breast. When Krishna was sucking her breast, mother Yasoda would see small teeth coming in. Thus her joy would be intensified to see her child grow. Within the house of Nanda Maharaja, the cowherd ladies would enjoy seeing the pastimes of Baby Krishna. The baby would catch the end of a calf's tail, and the calf would drag Him here and there. When the ladies saw these pastimes, they stopped their household activities and laughed and enjoyed the fun. Mother Yasoda felt she was unable to protect Baby Krishna from calamities threatened by horned cows, fire, animals with claws and teeth such as monkeys, dogs, and cats, and by thorns, swords, and other weapons on the ground. Thus she was always in anxiety, and her household engagements were disturbed. At that time she was fully absorbed in the transcendental ecstasy known as the distress of maternal affection for the Lord. ",

We cannot do anything. \"\"Krishna and Balarama find great pleasure in stealing our stock of yogurt and butter from wherever we keep it. When Krishna and Balarama are caught stealing the yogurt and butter, They say, “Why do you charge us with stealing? Do you think that butter and yogurt are scarce in our house?” Sometimes They steal buffer, yogurt, and milk and distribute them to the monkeys. When the monkeys are well fed and do not take any more, your boys chide,’ this milk and butter and yogurt are useless - even the monkeys won't take it’. Then They break the pots and throw hither and thither.” \"\"If we keep our stock of buffer and yogurt high on the ceiling, in a pot hanging on a swing, although it is beyond Their reach They try to reach it by piling all kinds of wooden planks on top of a grinding machine.

So we think that you'd better take all the jeweled ornaments from the bodies of your children.\"\" On hearing this, Yasoda would say, \"\"All right, I will take all the jewels from Krishna so that He cannot see the butter hidden in the darkness.\"\" Then the gopis would say, \"\"No, no, don't do this. What good will it do to take away the jewels? We do not know what kind of boys these are, but even without ornaments They spread some kind of effulgence so that even in the dark They can see everything.\"\" \"",
